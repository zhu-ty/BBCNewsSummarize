Birmingham bin strike: Council deal to end dispute accepted by union
The agreement was reached two days before the dispute was due to go before the High Court.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Birmingham bin strike: 'I'm working next to a bin mountain'Bin workers in Birmingham who were involved in a three-month strike have agreed a deal with the city council.Unite's Howard Beckett said it was a "victory for common sense" and meant the industrial action was over.The row started in June when Unite claimed the council's bid to "modernise" the service and save £5m a year threatened more than 100 jobs.The deal put forward by the council sees 106 staff remain on their current wages but in new recycling roles.The strikes led to thousands of tonnes of rubbish left piled up on the city's streets.Why did refuse workers strike in Birmingham?Mr Beckett, Unite assistant general secretary, said it would no longer be taking the council to the High Court on Monday and a "court order was expected to legally cement the agreement".A judge granted an interim injunction against the council in September and a trial was to determine if the council acted unlawfully.The council has agreed to pay Unite's legal costs, Mr Beckett said."This deal secures the grade three role and protects the pay of workers who faced losing thousands of pounds," he said.He added it was also a "victory" for residents "who no longer need worry about the disruption of industrial action".Ian Ward, leader of the Labour-run council, said the deal had been achieved through "quiet, open and honest dialogue", adding neither the council or Unite wanted things to escalate the way they did."This has always been about providing an efficient and effective refuse collection service for Birmingham, as that is what citizens rightly expect and deserve from us," he said.His predecessor, John Clancy resigned in September after criticism of his handling of the dispute.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Ward said the disruption had been "completely unacceptable" for residentsThe deal creates new waste reduction and collection officer roles who will be on bin lorries, focusing on recycling to help "engage and educate" residents.Sending less waste to landfill and increasing recycling by 10% is expected to save £1.6m a year.The authority also estimates £3m a year can be saved by changing workers' hours from a four-day to a five-day week - meaning less reliance on overtime and agency staff.

Australia knocks UK Brexit trade plan
The trade minister says splitting quotas of food imports could leave other countries out of pocket.
Image copyright AFP/Getty ImagesAustralia has criticised the UK's post-Brexit trade plans to split quotas of food imports from around the world.EU rules allow for a certain amount of goods to be brought in from countries outside of the Union without charging full tariffs.After Brexit, the UK and EU want to split these quotas, based on where the goods are mostly consumed.But Australian trade minister Steven Ciobo said it would impose unacceptable restrictions on their exports.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "The point is that you have a choice about where you place your quota at the moment."Therefore, given that you could put it in the UK or you could put it into continental Europe, why would we accept a proposition that would see a decline in the quota available because of the Brexit decision?"Dave Harrison, from Beef and Lamb New Zealand, agreed that its finances could be hit hard if they were not allowed to choose where to import more or less of their products.He told Today: "We understand that Brexit causes a lot of difficulties for the European governments, but we don't think third countries should have to take a hit in terms of their negotiated legal rights as a result of that."Shanker Singham, of The Legatum Institute, said the UK should talk to other countries about trade directly.He added: "We should be going to them and saying we have the ability - once we take up our chair at the WTO [World Trade Organisation] - to do trade agreements with you that will include a certain amount of liberalisation, depending on what you are prepared to give us."But if you damage us on the way to reclaiming our seat on the WTO, we are not going to be able to do those deals with you."The US, Brazil and Canada are also said to have their doubts about the new deal, believing it could hit them financially.A spokesman for the UK's Department of International Trade told Today the government wanted to minimise disruption to trading relationships and would engage with other members of the World Trade Organisation in an "open, inclusive way".Countryside impactMeanwhile, Tory MP Neil Parish, who chairs the environment, food and rural affairs committee in Parliament, raised concerns that if the UK's exports to the EU were hit post-Brexit and more imports were coming into the country from further afield, it could affect industries on our shores.Shadow international secretary of trade, Barry Gardiner, also said the wider implications could see an impact on the British countryside."As you affect farming, so you affect the way our country looks," he said. "That means you also affect the tourist trade."These are huge decisions that are being taken and we must protect our farmers to make sure that our countryside looks the way we want it to. "

Arlene Foster warns Sinn Féin time is short for NI deal
DUP leader says Sinn Féin must choose between making a deal with them or having direct rule ministers.
Image copyright Press Eye Image caption Arlene Foster said that all parties need to be "serious about obtaining a deal that is balanced"Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster has said Sinn Féin must choose between making a deal with them or having direct rule ministers in place.Speaking at the party's annual conference, she said "time is short".Mrs Foster also spoke of the DUP's influence in Westminster and the party's commitment to Brexit.DUP MPs are propping up the Conservative government as part of a confidence-and-supply deal.On the failure of talks between the DUP and Sinn Féin, Mrs Foster said that "some progress was made but that can only be built upon if all sides are genuinely serious about obtaining a deal that is balanced".The DUP-Sinn Féin power-sharing government fell apart in January following a row over a green energy scandal, which is now the subject of a public inquiry.A series of talks have failed to find agreement over issues including an Irish language act and same-sex marriage.Image copyright Pacemaker Image caption Arlene Foster told the DUP party conference that Sinn Féin needs to respect British culture"I said back in the summer that this party was prepared to legislate for the Irish language in the context of legislating for the plurality of cultures that exist in Northern Ireland," Mrs Foster told the conference in Belfast."The Irish language is spoken and enjoyed by thousands of people in all parts of Northern Ireland, it does no damage to our unionism or the Union we cherish."I respect the Irish language and those who speak it, however, respect isn't a one-way street."Respect works both ways."'Blocking restoration'Mrs Foster said Sinn Féin needed to "respect our British culture"."For too long they have shown nothing but disdain and disrespect for the national flag, the Royal Family, the Armed Forces, British symbols, the constitutional reality and the very name of this country."Time is short and those in Sinn Féin blocking the restoration of local decision making need to decide whether they want to do business with us or have direct rule ministers in place."I still believe that devolution is the best way to govern Northern Ireland, but to do that in a way that delivers for all of our people we need serious partners in government."On Brexit, Mrs Foster said it was "perhaps the most substantial and complex process the government and parliament had undertaken in the modern political era".She reiterated her desire to find a solution for Northern Ireland that would not harm the country's economic relationship with either the rest of the UK or the Republic of Ireland."As we joined the then European Community as one nation we will leave as one United Kingdom," she said.Responding to Mrs Foster's address, Sinn Féin's Stormont leader, Michelle O'Neill said she and her party "remained committed to making the institutions work," but said: "They must operate on the basis agreed 20 years ago.""A majority of citizens in the north expect and are entitled to the same rights enjoyed by citizens across these islands; language and marriage equality rights, due process in all aspects of the legal and judicial system, including inquests."DeadlockEarlier, the party's deputy leader Nigel Dodds told the conference that the deal with the Conservative Party was "in the national interest" and an opportunity for Northern Ireland."Our interests in the negotiations were not in seats for ourselves at the cabinet table but in jobs and investment for our people," he said."Our goal is not to push some narrow DUP agenda but to deliver for the whole community in Northern Ireland," he added.Image copyright Press Eye Image caption Nigel Dodds said that the time is coming when direct rule will be "the lesser of two evils"The Conservative Party are represented at the conference through senior minister Damian Green and chief whip Julian Smith, who is due to give a keynote speech on Saturday afternoon.Mr Dodds also addressed the ongoing political deadlock at Stormont.Mr Dodds said Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire must soon consider implementing direct rule if no deal is struck."While we understand, because of the talks process and the absence of ministers, things have been more difficult, within a very short space of time that will not be a tenable excuse for not taking action," he said."None of us want to see direct rule introduced but we are fast approaching the moment when it will be the lesser of two evils."
Senior Police Scotland officer suspended amid criminal conduct probe
Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins is suspended as an investigation into criminal conduct begins.
A senior officer from Police Scotland has been suspended amid an investigation into criminal conduct.Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins was suspended with immediate effect by the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) on Friday afternoon.Three other officers have also been suspended and two have been placed on restricted duties.A spokesman for ACC Higgins said he "denies and rejects" any allegations of wrongdoing.The independent police watchdog is investigating allegations of criminal conduct and gross misconduct.In a statement, Deputy Chief Constable Iain Livingstone confirmed the suspension of ACC Higgins, who was responsible for operational support, custody and criminal justice.He said: "I can confirm that Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins was suspended today by the Scottish Police Authority."In addition, three other officers have been suspended, and two others placed on restricted duties, by Deputy Chief Constable Rose Fitzpatrick."This is in connection with an investigation by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc)."At this time our focus must remain on continuing to meet the operational challenges that we face each day."Anonymous allegationsHe added that Assistant Chief Constable Nelson Telfer would take responsibility for the operational support portfolio.However a spokesman for ACC Higgins said he denied wrongdoing."He will fully cooperate with the investigation. He intends to resume his duties as soon as this matter has been resolved," he added.BBC Scotland understands the allegations are connected to a wider criminal investigation.They are not connected to the separate Pirc investigations into allegations of misconduct against Chief Constable Phil Gormley who is currently on "special leave."Nor are they connected to inquiries into allegations that officers in the former counter-corruption unit abused their position when attempting to find the source of a journalist's information.Who is Bernie Higgins?ACC Higgins joined Strathclyde Police in 1988 and served in uniform posts across Glasgow and Lanarkshire.He became a superintendent in 2006 and was then promoted to detective chief superintendent and head of the public protection unit in 2010.Later in 2010, he was made divisional commander in charge of Glasgow Central and West Division.He was appointed Strathclyde Police Temporary Assistant Chief Constable (Territorial Policing) in March 2012.In January 2013, he became assistant chief constable of Police Scotland with responsibility for operational support before assuming responsibility for the wider justice and support portfolio.In his current role, which he was appointed to in September last year, he has responsibility for the operational support, custody and criminal justice divisions.The decision to suspend Mr Higgins was taken by the SPA board after it was alerted to the criminal and misconduct allegations by the Pirc.In a statement, the SPA said the suspension would be reviewed in four weeks or if there is a change in circumstances.The Pirc said it initially referred the anonymous allegations to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, as it is responsible for the prosecution of crime.Misconduct investigationThe Crown Office decided an independent investigation should be carried out by the Pirc and that is now under way.As the complaint also included allegations of misconduct by a senior police officer, the commissioner referred the matters to the SPA on 18 October.The SPA suspended Mr Higgins on Friday and referred allegations of gross misconduct to the PircThe commissioner is now carrying out an assessment to establish whether a misconduct investigation is required.'Get a grip'A spokesman for the commissioner said: "Following receipt of anonymous allegations of criminality by officers, including a senior officer, serving with Police Scotland, the Commissioner referred the allegations to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS)."This was to allow the COPFS to consider whether the criminal allegations should be investigated by the Commissioner."The COPFS decided that an independent investigation should be carried out by the PIRC and this is now under way."The Scottish government has issued a statement saying that as the matter was under investigation by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner it was unable to comment further.However, Liam Kerr, the justice spokesman for the Conservative Party, called for Scotland's justice secretary to come "out of the shadows" on the difficulties faced by Police Scotland.He told BBC Radio Scotland: "The conspicuous absences of the justice secretary - my view would be that he's got to step out of the shadows and get a grip on this because it keeps happening on his watch."

Ice delays trains as cold snap continues
The UK is warned of further frosty weather after temperatures plunged below freezing overnight.
Image copyright PA Image caption There has already been snow across parts of ScotlandIcy conditions caused train delays of up to 90 minutes on Saturday, after temperatures dropped below freezing in parts of the country overnight.Network Rail said some Southern, Gatwick Express and Thameslink lines were forced to run at reduced speeds.South Western Railway also warned of delays due to ice, which came on top of planned weekend engineering works.Temperatures fell to lows of -5.2C in Yorkshire, as forecasters said the wintry weather looked set to continue.Icy nightThe Met Office has issued a yellow warning for ice across Northern Ireland, north-west and south-west England and much of Scotland between 20:00 on Saturday and 10:00 GMT on Sunday.The yellow warning advises people to "be aware" that conditions will turn icy again tonight, with rain, sleet and hail showers continuing.Following the frosty start to the day, BBC Weather forecasted a cold and bright day with wintry showers in the north and west of England.The showers will fall as snow over the hills and to low levels in the north, and perhaps in some parts of the Midlands.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Snowy scenes in Pitlochry, Scotland, on FridayDr Thomas Waite, from Public Health England, reminded people to take precautions."Those most at risk include older people, very young children and those with conditions like heart and lung disease," he said."Ask yourself if you could check on a neighbour to see if there's anything they need?"Figures from the Office for National Statistics, showed an estimated 34,400 "excess deaths" occurred in England and Wales last winter.Salt on roadsImage copyright PAMeanwhile, councils in England and Wales have stockpiled 1.5 million tonnes of salt for roads this winter.Nine out of 10 councils in England and Wales either have the same amount of salt as last year or even more, according to the Local Government Association (LGA).More than half of councils are sharing salt stocks, while others share gritters and staff when required.With temperatures falling, some local authorities have already deployed gritters on to roads.There have already been heavy snowfalls in the Scottish Highlands this week, where icy conditions caused a number of road accidents.Meanwhile in Lancashire, more than 70 people had to be rescued from floods.
The early Christmas gift everyone's buying
How Advent has gone from chocolate treats for children to an extravagant present-filled bonanza.
Image copyright Marks&Spencer Image caption Marks and Spencer had a waiting list of more than 45,000 online customers for its 2017 calendarAdvent calendars used to be a cheap way to count down to Christmas with a seasonal picture or chocolate treat, but behind the doors you can now find everything from expensive whisky to fancy face cream. Are they a rip-off that represents the ever-growing commercialism of Christmas, or just a harmless bit of festive fun?"Christmas isn't like it used to be," is a familiar refrain. Yet even putting the rose-tinted spectacles aside, one element of the festive period - advent calendars - really have come a long way.There has long been a tradition in some Christian denominations to mark off the days of Advent, from lighting candles to the calendar's austere origins in 19th Century Germany when 24 chalk lines were rubbed off doors.But counting down to a festival marking the birth of Jesus has changed, from finding cheap chocolate behind the door of a pretty picture - a style popularised in the 1990s - to an extravagant present-filled bonanza boasting everything from pork scratchings to posh toiletries.Image copyright John Lewis Image caption Traditional card advent calendars are still popular, says John LewisThese bumper versions vary wildly in price, ranging from £10,000 for a rare whisky version, to a rather more modest cheese offering for £8 from Asda.But despite the sometimes eye-watering cost, some do represent value for money, according to MoneySavingExpert's Gary Caffell."If you want to give yourself a small daily treat of your favourite tipple, cheese or crisp, Advent calendars such as these are meant to be a bit of festive fun. So if that's why you're buying it and you're happy with the overall price, you may not be too fussed about the value you're getting behind each window.""Self-rewarding" is how consumer psychologist Kate Nightingale, founder of consultancy Style Psychology puts it.When you are rushing around trying to please everyone else, treating yourself to an early present is one way to cheer yourself up, she says.Chloe Haskoll, 34, says that is exactly why she bought a beauty advent calendar for herself this year."I'm not keen on chocolate and like the idea of a daily pick-me up. They're not cheap but I find December exhausting so it's a well deserved treat, I reckon," she says.Image copyright Chloe Haskoll Image caption Chloe Haskoll says her beauty calendar will be a "pick-me up" in a tough monthMr Caffell says beauty calendars tend to provide the best savings as they can be a cheaper way to buy a lot of products from one of the bigger brands, and any products you don't want can be given as stocking-fillers."Boots No7, M&S and Body Shop all have popular calendars which are worth looking out for, as you get products worth a lot more than the price of the Advent calendar itself."Natalie Oakley, who is behind beauty blog Lady Like Momma, has been known to stay up for the midnight launch of such calendars and tracks the launch dates in magazines and online."I choose a calendar based on two things," says the writer, from Sedgley in the West Midlands. "I either go for a brand I know and love already, or brands that I am keen to try out."And the second thing is the style [and] packaging. I think when you are spending quite a lot on a calendar you want it to look good in your home and I personally want to be able to use it again the following year and add my own things to the drawers."Image copyright Lady Like Momma Image caption Natalie Oakley reuses her beauty calendars by adding her own things to the drawersImage copyright Cadbury Image caption Cadbury launched its first Advent calendar in 1971, but only started producing them every Christmas from 1993Luxury calendars are a very recent phenomenon - department store Liberty's coveted beauty calendar, which sold out online in 39 hours this year, only launched in 2014.Even chocolate calendars only really became commonplace in the 1990s, says Alex Hutchinson, archivist and historian for Nestle."It wasn't until after World War Two and after rationing ended that chocolate became a more affordable purchase."Chocolate was so expensive that manufacturers couldn't afford to put it in an Advent calendar. By the 1960s, people got back into the habit of treating it as a grocery product but [the idea of chocolate being linked to Advent] would still have been a bit sacrilegious."You might also like:Cadbury's says the company launched its first Advent calendar in 1971, with production the following year and again between 1978 and 1980.It wasn't until 1993 the firm began to produce them continuously, when it became more routinely adopted as a Christmas tradition.But trying to marry the commercial desire to sell more during what is, after all, a religious festival, requires some sensitivity.When bakery chain Greggs promoted its advent calendar by swapping Jesus for a sausage roll in a nativity scene, some said it had gone too far.YouTube star Zoella also came a cropper when parents complained that her £50 12-window calendar was "overpriced tat", prompting Boots to halve the price to £25.Image copyright Greggs Image caption Greggs was forced to apologise for swapping Jesus for a sausage roll in its advent calendar promotionThere are other less obvious pitfalls for retailers.Those fiddly boxes and unusual shapes mean they can be difficult and expensive to make, something pork scratchings firm Snaffling Pig found to its cost when it launched its first calendar last year.The firm's founder Andy Allen says a combination of the A3 size, which took up almost all their warehouse space; and the need to produce the calendar in a short space of time to keep the product fresh, "almost broke them".The result was that they had less than a month to make and then post out 11,000 calendars before 1 December."It piled on a lot of pressure," he says.This year, they are making about 45,000 calendars and have outsourced the fiddly filling and calendar construction to a team."It is a bit more controlled," he says.Image copyright Daniel Jarvis Image caption Snaffling Pig struggled to make all its Advent calendars on time last yearFor larger firms like John Lewis, Advent is akin to a military operation.Head of Christmas products Dan Cooper has already picked his first set of calendars for next Christmas and across all styles, sales are up 48% so far this year.The chain launched its own £149 beauty product calendar for the first time this year, and the 3,000 it made have already sold out.Mr Cooper believes the growing popularity of more luxurious calendars is partly down to the ever earlier spread of "Christmas hysteria".But he says the real shift is that calendars have become "a family thing". Advent, it seems, is no longer just for kids.Image copyright John Lewis Image caption John Lewis says the Lego advent calendars are its strongest sellersAngus Thirlwell is the chief executive and founder of chocolate chain Hotel Chocolat, which has been selling a "posh calendar" pitched squarely at adults for nearly a decade now.He says people are generally buying calendars in addition to their usual Christmas gifts - not instead of them - and Advent has now become "a season in its own right"."That's why we like it," he says.But isn't festive commercialism getting a bit out of hand?"It's difficult to take the hedonism out of Christmas, the genie has already escaped the bottle," says Mr Thirlwell.Image copyright Eamonn M. McCormack Image caption Men outnumbered women by two to one in the queue to buy Liberty's calendar this yearRetailers, of course, say these calendars are a good deal - to the point of printing it on your receipt.In a clever marketing ploy. Marks & Spencer's beauty calendar (which is £35 if you spend an additional £35 on non-food products), flashes up at the till at £250, which is what the company says it's worth before the price is reduced.But customer reviews show they believe the chance to try more expensive products than they could normally afford makes them worth it.And glowing skin isn't necessarily the only bonus. Some calendars' popularity mean they can be lucrative.Liberty's £175 beauty calendars are now listed on auction site eBay at double the original price, for example.The idea that shops are deliberately under-stocking their calendars to create a fake rush is a "myth" according to Mr Cooper, who adds that changing trends mean "things sometimes sell better than expected".But however big your advent calendar is, and whatever you paid for it, there's still one big challenge left - stopping yourself from opening all those tempting little windows at once.
The firms being creative with food destined for the bin
A growing number of businesses are finding creative uses for surplus food - but will the trend ever go mainstream?
Image copyright Twitter Image caption Bean & Wheat's pates, pickles and desserts are made with off-cuts and surplus fruit and vegA rising number of firms are finding creative uses for surplus food. But are consumers comfortable eating produce that would have otherwise ended up in the bin?On the surface there seems little that's different or unusual about Bean & Wheat, a deli and cafe hidden away in a cobbled alleyway close to Liverpool Street Station in London.But the food I'm tucking into - Kilner jars filled with delicious goods such as piccalilli and vegan chocolate mousse with a creamy tofu topping - has all been made from ingredients that would have otherwise been thrown away.Adam Handling launched Bean & Wheat in June to use surplus food from the kitchen of his nearby restaurant, The Frog E1.The Masterchef finalist wanted to help reduce the around 199,000 tonnes of food waste produced each year by British restaurants, which he feels not only harms the environment but also "wastes money".Bean & Wheat's dishes include salads made from unusual parts of vegetables, such as cauliflower stalks, pates made with off-cuts, and oils made with the tops of the herbs which are usually binned.Image copyright Adam Handling Image caption Adam Handling reuses surplus food from the kitchen at his restaurant, the Frog E1Mr Handling also makes his own compost from vegetable peelings, cold-pressed juices from misshapen fruit, and even soap with coffee grounds."One of my priorities is to minimise food waste at my restaurants to the point that we have hardly any," he says.Bean & Wheat is just one of a rising number of companies looking to tackle the issue of food waste, which sees a third of food produced for human consumption lost or wasted, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation. That's equivalent to 1.3 billion tonnes globally every year.The overproduction of food, rules restricting the sale of discoloured or "wonky" produce, and an aversion to leftovers, despite them being perfectly fine to eat, are all to blame.And campaigners say that not only is such waste morally wrong, it also wastes water and worsens global warming as swelling landfills emit more greenhouse gasses.Image copyright Astrid Templier Image caption Rubies in the Rubble condiments are made with "ugly" fruit and vegJenny Dawson Costa quit her job in the hedge fund industry in 2011 and launched Rubies in the Rubble, hoping to offer a "practical solution" to the problem.The British firm uses unwanted "ugly" fruit and veg from UK farms to make condiments, such as pink onion and chilli relish, banana ketchup and piccalilli. Its products are available in 500 stockists, including Waitrose, Selfridges and independent stores.Ms Dawson says that since she started, the public has become more aware about the issue of food waste and more open to eating surplus food."Many consumers used to be put off by it and were worried about the quality but I think that's changing. Brands like ours are also showing it can be used in products that taste great," she adds, noting that her firm has won several awards.Indeed, even major retailers are embracing the trend, with Tesco and Asda among those now stocking misshapen fruit and veg.More stories from the BBC's Business Brain series looking at interesting business topics from around the world:Image copyright Rubies in the Rubble Image caption Rubies in the Rubble's products are sold in Waitrose and SelfridgesOthers are taking a different approach to tackling the problem, such as Danish tech company Too Good To Go.It is one of a number of new apps that allow customers to buy unsold food from local restaurants, cafes and bakeries for knockdown prices.The firm works with more than 6,000 food businesses including Yo! Sushi and Exmouth Coffee Company, and operates in six countries including the UK, Sweden and Germany.Co-founder Chris Wilson says it has saved two million meals from the bin since its launch in June 2016, however the firm still has to fight against negative perceptions around surplus food."Whilst there's been a shift in the mentality of people, most people are sceptical - the vast majority of the UK still looks upon food waste as being scraps from people's plates. With us it's not that at all."Image copyright Too good to go Image caption Jamie Crummie and Chris Wilson co-founded Too good to goTrish Caddy, a food industry analyst at Mintel, also believes surplus food continues to be stigmatised."Consumers have high demands for companies to address food waste, but currently that does not translate to their own behaviour and it remains to be seen if the trend will go mainstream soon."She points to a Mintel survey, which found that 77% of those who eat out or buy takeaways agree that restaurants should be more committed to reducing food waste, but only 17% are interested in eating dishes made from food that was due to be thrown away.Of course, the hospitality industry will not be able tackle the problem of food waste alone.Manufacturers, retailers and most importantly households - the biggest producers of food waste - must all play their part, says UK charity the Waste & Resources Action Programme.However, Mr Handling says that every little helps and there are plenty of ways food businesses can contribute."They can incorporate more 'nose-to-tail' cooking, send anything that can't be cooked to be composted, or find another way to use off-cuts and by-products, or donate leftovers to charities as some restaurants and supermarkets do."It's about taking a second to think 'have I absolutely exhausted all possibilities with this ingredient?' before throwing it away."
'I'm surprised that football fanzines have survived'
The BBC takes a look at fanzine editors' favourite covers and the inspiration behind them.
Image copyright Paul GilhamThe purchase of a fanzine remains part of the match-day routine for many football fans, who value an independent, sideways and often light-hearted take on the state of their beloved clubs. The BBC has asked the editors of five publications that are still in print - despite the competition from online offerings - to choose their favourite covers."In some ways I'm surprised that fanzines have survived," says Malcolm Clarke, chair of the Football Supporters Federation."You might have thought with the rise of social media and the internet they would have vanished years ago, but they haven't."I think it is partly due to in some cases a sense of great loyalty... but also because some have very high-quality writing."The Gooner - ArsenalImage copyright The GoonerMike Francis admits that he was pretty much goaded into forming The Gooner, one of the country's oldest fanzines.During a trip to a bookshop on Charing Cross Road, he picked up a Chelsea fanzine for his then boss, a Blues supporter, and was given the reply: "That just proves we are a bigger club."London rivalry also features in one of Mr Francis' favourite covers."Around the time that that cover came out [November 1988] we were on a run where we were beating Spurs every time we played them," he remembers."Clearly, as Arsenal fans that was a high point of the season."We'd probably beaten them five or six times [in a row] and that was how that cover came about because we were asking: 'How are Spurs ever going to win a derby?'"We then thought of the most famous Derby winner, Shergar, and that was how the two came together."Despite its popularity, Mr Francis admits he still "cringes" at his "amateurish" drawing of a horse in a Tottenham shirt.Image copyright The GoonerThe fanzine has become more polished in its appearance over the years.The idea for the cover of Issue 235, which featured manager Arsene Wenger in style of a Roy Lichtenstein portrait, came about during a trip on the London Underground."I think I just saw an advert on the Tube for a Roy Lichtenstein exhibition and I just thought that it would make a great style for a cover."Darren [the fanzine's designer] was always keen to try new things so I suggested it to him and that is what he came up with."At the height of its popularity, Mr Francis estimates they were selling 7,500 copies of each issue, but that figure has dwindled to about 2,000.The Gooner will cease publication at the end of this season.The Square Ball - Leeds UnitedImage copyright The Square Ball"Some of the best fanzines have some of the worst [football club] owners," says one of The Square Ball's co-editors, Paul O'Dowd.First published in 1989, the fanzine has covered league titles and Champions League football, but also the lows of administration and relegation to English football's third tier.Mr O'Dowd, who runs the fanzine with three others, says one of his favourite issues they have produced is the "Kenopoly" edition.Produced during the 2009-10 season, it was what Mr O'Dowd describes as a "sarcastic and satirical" look at the way then Leeds owner Ken Bates ran the club."We were working on it for a couple of months... it just seemed to sum up Ken Bates," he says."He would use everybody else's money for whatever business he was doing."It was just our way of being sarcastic and having a go at Ken Bates in a very artistic way."Image copyright The Square BallMr O'Dowd says another of his favourite covers was the "Hoof" edition from 2012-13, mocking the "horrible" style of football played during Neil Warnock's tenure.He says that when the editorial team saw the photo of Michael Brown, it perfectly encapsulated the topic that they wanted to cover.The headline, written in the style of an Oxford English Dictionary entry, helped to get their simple message across, Mr O'Dowd says.He explains: "It was to the point, very matter of fact."It just summed up the football at the time that was just horrible, and we were paying top dollar to watch it which was the annoying thing."United We Stand - Manchester UnitedImage copyright United We StandUnited We Stand has been following the fortunes of Manchester United since the fanzine was a created by a 15-year-old Andy Mitten in 1989.He says its focus on original content has kept it popular through 275 editions.One of the publication's early editions gained notoriety, when it wrongly called the outcome of the 1991-92 First Division title race, the last campaign before the introduction the following season of the Premier League.United We Stand's headline read: "Champions at Last," a nod to the fact that they had not been champions for 25 years.But the Red Devils then lost three games in a row to hand the title to arch-rivals Leeds.Image copyright Getty Images"I'd had 4,000 copies printed and I was stood outside Old Trafford making an absolute fool out of myself," Mr Mitten remembers."I was getting loads of abuse because of it, and quite rightly so."Perhaps luckily for Mr Mitten, a recent house move means he can no longer locate that particular cover, but its notoriety endures.He is more fond of the June 2017 edition, a tribute to Wayne Rooney before the club's record goal-scorer left to rejoin Everton."At the time, most United fans online saw him as persona non grata," he says."[The cover] was our way of saying... he has clearly dipped as a player but he has been a fantastic player here."We've put him all of these different shirts because Manchester United change their shirt every five minutes, because they are a commercial beast like every football club."But there was nothing commercial about that goal [the one depicted on the cover] - it was just pure beauty."Blowing Bubbles Monthly - West Ham UnitedImage copyright David BlackmoreBlowing Bubbles Monthly is the brainchild of David Blackmore and has been entertaining West Ham fans since 2012.The fanzine was initially going to be online only, but a test print run proved so popular it is now produced monthly.Its editor, David Blackmore, says their September 2016 edition (pictured above) is one of his favourites."In a season full of highs and lows... it just captured one of the brighter moments, that first goal at the London Stadium," he says."We also had an interview with [co-owner] David Gold in there which set the tone for the rest of the season."We just felt page after page it was one of our stronger issues."Image copyright David BlackmoreThe September 2017 issue is one Mr Blackmore says feels significant because they "stuck their neck out" and questioned then manager Slaven Bilic's position.He says the decision was not taken lightly."I think most knew that Bilic was on the brink at that time," Mr Blackmore adds."That vocal minority who were calling for his head had gathered momentum and by September it was starting to go full power."Given that the Croatian would be sacked just a few weeks later, it appears Blowing Bubbles, picked their moment perfectly.Bandy & Shinty - Nottingham ForestImage copyright Bandy & ShintyThe team in charge of the unusually named Bandy & Shinty, a relatively new Nottingham Forest fanzine, freely admit they are not "traditional fanzine sellers".Born out of a meeting at a pub to celebrate the club's 150th anniversary, the four-man team behind the publication tend to send out their fanzine via post.The appeal? The chance to still enjoy match-days with family.The fanzine's name is a nod to the two hockey clubs that met to form Nottingham Forest in 1865.History also is an important part of each issue's cover."The Brian Clough one (pictured) was extremely popular," says Sean Hockett, one of the team behind Bandy & Shinty."I like the fact that a fair number of Forest fans will just be able to identify that image."It is based on a photograph when he is sort of laissez-faire."He has got his thumb to his nose and he is almost irreverent about the fact he is having his photograph taken."It just encapsulates Brian Clough as a character."Image copyright Bandy & ShintyMr Hockett says issue six is also a personal favourite, because it features their most detailed piece of cover art."It has taken us out of that zone of just using a silhouetted image," he adds."I like the fact you have got the image of John Robertson in the middle of the passport instead of the Queen."As a piece of art I just think it's lovely."
Darkest Hour: Gary Oldman on the 'challenge' of Churchill
The actor discusses his new film Darkest Hour (and his own chances of Oscars success).
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gary Oldman on what it was like playing Winston ChurchillMichael Gambon, Brian Cox, John Lithgow - we've seen several actors take on the role of Winston Churchill in recent years. Could Gary Oldman's portrayal land him an Academy Award?On the evening of 11 September, as the credits rolled on wartime drama Darkest Hour, the audience in Toronto's Roy Thomson Hall rose to their feet to applaud Gary Oldman and the film's cast and crew.The Toronto International Film Festival prides itself on picking out potential awards winners. And in the days following the screening it was Oldman's astonishing Churchill that dominated conversation after conversation - with many declaring him the clear frontrunner for the best actor Oscar.A couple of months later, Gary Oldman, sitting in a London hotel, remains the odds-on favourite, but is understandably reluctant to talk his Academy Award chances, instead offering: "I feel very lucky, very privileged to have been offered it, and to have actually played it."So I think I've got out of it what I wanted to get out of it. Anything else beyond that is a cherry on the cake."When pressed he does concede: "If I had an Oscar that said on it Gary Oldman, best actor for Darkest Hour, if I was going to get an Oscar, I can't think of a better part to get it for, let's put it that way."Image copyright UniversalIt's easy to see why it's thought that Gary Oldman's Winston Churchill will resonate with awards voters. He's long overdue proper Oscar recognition (he's only ever received one nomination - for the 2011 spy drama Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy).His Churchill is the kind of full throated performance that audiences and critics love. And his transformation from quiet voiced actor into Britain's bellowing wartime leader is indeed truly remarkable."I knew I didn't look like him, I thought that with some work I could approximate the voice," Oldman confesses. "The challenge in part was the physicality because you're playing someone whose silhouette is so iconic."So I went to the newsreel, and what I discovered was a man who had this very athletic tread. He would skip around at 65 like a 30-year-old, he had a sparkle, the eyes were alive, he had a very sort of cherubic grin.Image copyright Universal"You know we think of this sort of rather depressed grumpy man with a cigar, and from the footage and from what I was reading I discovered someone who was just really alive and dynamic. And that's what I hoped to really bring to it, and give him a bit of a twinkle in the eye."Churchill is, of course, one of British history's best known figures, his speeches are famous in the UK and abroad. Audiences' familiarity with the real life man could have proved problematic for any actor playing him."I think you get to a point where it has to become creation rather the impersonation, you try and get the spirit of the essence of the man," says Oldman.An additional complication is that Churchill has been played many, many times on TV and in film by a succession of distinguished actors.Image copyright Universal"You've not only got this sort of beloved Briton, this iconic figure who is arguably the greatest Briton who ever lived," says Oldman, "but you've also got the gallery of other people."So you've got this image of Churchill, but is that contaminated or in any way influenced by Albert Finney as Churchill or Robert Hardy as Churchill?"Festivalgoers and audiences in the United States where the film opened this week seem more than confident that this portrayal of Churchill is 100%, uncontaminated Oldman. And critics expect his performance and the film to be prominent players at awards ceremonies over the next few months.Darkest Hour opens in the UK on Friday 12 January 2018.
My son had a stroke when he was just 13
Neil Ferguson was a sporty 13-year-old when a stroke left him suffering from paralysis and speech problems.
Image copyright Stroke Association Image caption Neil has managed to return to school though he still struggles to speakNeil Ferguson was a sporty 13-year-old when a stroke left him suffering from paralysis and speech problems.His mother Lynne Meekison told BBC Scotland's Stephen Jardine programme it was "very much out of the blue".She now traces the problem back to an injury during a school rugby game in November 2015.It appears Neil, from Morningside in Edinburgh, suffered a carotid artery dissection during the match. But this was not known at the time and it was three weeks later that he suffered the stroke.Lynne, who is a doctor herself, says: "He had torn the artery in his neck supplying the brain and a clot had formed and flew off into his brain."Image caption Neil's mum Lynne says the injury that led to the stroke was a freak accidentShe says it was "very much a freak accident" and she does not blame rugby at all.In fact, at the time they thought it was nothing more than a sore neck.Lynne says Neil was 6ft tall, even though he was only 13, and always threw himself into tackles."The sore neck went on for a couple of days then eased off," Neil's mum says."He had the odd headache for the next few weeks and then very suddenly without any warning at all he got up and things were clearly not right."Image copyright Stroke Association Image caption Neil has learnt how to canoe one-handed with a special paddleAccording to Lynne, Neil got dressed but forgot about the right-hand side of his body."His arm was not in a sleeve, he did not have a sock and shoe on that side, his arm was limp at his side and he could not speak at all," she says.Within a couple of minutes he had become unconscious and was taken to A&E at the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh.Image copyright Stroke Association Image caption Neil was a keen swimmer before his stroke and he is againDespite her medical background, Lynne works as a gastroenterologist, she says she did not think it was a stroke.She says: "I said to my husband 'it's like he's having a stroke, but it can't be'."The results of an MRI showed it was.Neil was transferred to a children's hospital and his brain started to swell more.On Boxing Day 2015 he was prepared for an operation to remove a section of his skull because the brain swelling was so severe, but it was deferred when he opened his eyes.After a week he started to be able to respond by moving his head but there was "absolutely no speech at all" and he was paralysed down his right side.Image copyright Stroke Association Image caption Neil has taken up hobbies such carting as part of his recoveryIn the two years since his stroke, Neil has made great efforts to recover his speech and movement.His mother says: "The fantastic thing is that his personality is absolutely unchanged."He is exactly the same person as before with the same quiet determination to achieve what he can and he has never, ever moaned about what has happened to him."She says he has worked hard with his speech.Image copyright Stroke Association Image caption Neil and family at the Stroke Association’s Life After Stroke Awards"He is now able to express himself, given time and given support and patience to be able to do so," Lynne says."Speaking is very hard work for him. It is very tiring but it is improving."Neil has also worked hard with a physiotherapist and can now stand and walk with the aid of a leg splint.He still does not have the use of his right arm but he goes to the gym and continues to work on improving it.Image copyright Stroke AssociationNeil is also back swimming.His mum says: "His only goal was to learn to swim again. He had a fantastic physio who got him into hydrotherapy and then into a disability swim club."It is early stages but he is very determined. He only swims with one arm and one good healthy leg."It is very difficult to stay in a straight line and breathing is difficult but it is great for him."Neil, who is now 15, will sit his National 5 exams next year.His mother says he is doing the best he can but he is still recovering from his devastating illness.She says: "The main thing is he wants to be as happy and fit as possible."He is trying to be like very other teenager."Guidelines on childhood strokeThe Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has issued new guidelines for diagnosis, management and rehabilitation of children suffering from a stroke.Dr Vijeya Ganesan, a paediatric neurologist who was involved in drafting the guidelines, said the causes in children were different to adults, where smoking and high blood pressure were often responsible.She said: "I think a really important factor is infection. It seems that affected children are often predisposed to respond to infection in an unusual way, which can result in a stroke."However, the signs of stroke in children are very similar to the signs in adults - weakness at the side of the face, difficulty in speaking, difficulty moving one side of the body."Stroke in children can have more subtle features, such as fitting affecting one side of the body or sudden severe headaches, for instance."
Are mince pies too boozy for children?
A woman was asked for ID over a mince pie - so how much alcohol is in the festive treats and are they OK for kids?
Image copyright Getty ImagesA 21-year-old woman was refused a mince pie in Asda as she did not have her ID - so how boozy are these festive pastries and are they suitable for children?The mince pie mix-up in Telford was down to a member of staff "trying to do the right thing" says Asda, where only foods containing "liquid" Christmas spirit are age-restricted.But this week a concerned parent started a thread on Mumsnet entitled "feeding children mince pies with brandy in", asking: "Have I been getting my kids drunk on brandy?"The consensus was "no", and as one member put it: "It's fine. It's not as if you handed them both a bottle of brandy and told them to crack on."So how much alcohol is in a mince pie?Chef Marcus Bean says he would be "surprised" if any shop-bought varieties contained much alcohol."I wouldn't worry about my children eating mince pies," he says. "We all love them and like to make our own."I use alcohol in cooking for my family as it gives an overall robust flavour.Image copyright Leo Holden Snooty Fox Images Image caption Marcus Bean says he does not worry about his children eating mince pies"I haven't tested them but I'd say by the time I've cooked a recipe the amount of alcohol will have reduced, leaving very little left."If anyone is really worried, they should just make their own mincemeat - it's pretty easy to do."When buying if in doubt, check the ingredients and it will say if it contains any alcohol - some don't."Should parents be worried?Mother-of-two Laura Butler, 31, from Shropshire, says she wouldn't lose any sleep over her children eating a mince pie.Image copyright Laura Butler Image caption Laura Butler and daughter Marley bake their own mince pies"I am very conscious of what I feed my children, keeping sweets and snacks to a minimum," she says."We do a lot of baking and cooking together and when we make mince pies at Christmas we leave the alcohol out."But if Marley eats a shop-bought one I'm not worried. The amount of alcohol in them will be minute."I can't say I've ever felt tipsy after one too many mince pies."Image copyright Laura Butler Image caption Marley makes her own booze-free mince piesHow many mince pies equate to a glass of wine?Well that depends on how boozy the recipe is and the size of the pie, but where is the harm in a few sums?BBC Good Food's recipe for "boozy mincemeat" makes 3.5kg or 7lb of the festive filling.If we copy the ratios of Sainsbury's deep-filled mince pies, each one weighs 60g and the filling accounts for 47%.So that means we will have 28.2g of our boozy mincemeat in each pie.Our 3.5kg of mincemeat would make about 124 pies - it's a full house this year.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The majority of alcohol in mince pies is lost during cooking, according to chef Marcus BeanThe recipe asks for 125ml of dark rum and 175ml of French brandy.Divided by the 124 pies that's roughly 1ml of rum and 1.4ml of brandy. So altogether, 2.4ml of spirits.There is one unit of alcohol in a standard 25ml measure of each of those spiritsSo in theory, you'd have to eat more than 10 mince pies to take in the equivalent of a single unit of alcohol - but, as Mr Bean says, most of the alcohol content will have been lost during cooking so you're more likely to get full before you get tipsy.Are mince pies safe for recovering alcoholics?Some food banks ask people not to donate food that contains alcohol, like mince pies and Christmas puddings,Sam Little at Silklife Foodbank in Macclesfield says this is because the taste of alcohol can act as a trigger for people who have experienced alcohol problems."The purpose of our food bank is to provide people with emergency food relief," he says."Our food parcels contain a wide variety of items, but we don't give out anything containing alcohol."This is out of respect to those people who may have some sort of struggle with alcohol addiction - we want to help people, not make life harder for them."This story has been amended to clarify that 10 mince pies are unlikely to actually contain one unit of alcohol.

Arlene Foster warns Sinn Féin time is short for NI deal
DUP leader says Sinn Féin must choose between making a deal with them or having direct rule ministers.
Image copyright Press Eye Image caption Arlene Foster said that all parties need to be "serious about obtaining a deal that is balanced"Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster has said Sinn Féin must choose between making a deal with them or having direct rule ministers in place.Speaking at the party's annual conference, she said "time is short".Mrs Foster also spoke of the DUP's influence in Westminster and the party's commitment to Brexit.DUP MPs are propping up the Conservative government as part of a confidence-and-supply deal.On the failure of talks between the DUP and Sinn Féin, Mrs Foster said that "some progress was made but that can only be built upon if all sides are genuinely serious about obtaining a deal that is balanced".The DUP-Sinn Féin power-sharing government fell apart in January following a row over a green energy scandal, which is now the subject of a public inquiry.A series of talks have failed to find agreement over issues including an Irish language act and same-sex marriage.Image copyright Pacemaker Image caption Arlene Foster told the DUP party conference that Sinn Féin needs to respect British culture"I said back in the summer that this party was prepared to legislate for the Irish language in the context of legislating for the plurality of cultures that exist in Northern Ireland," Mrs Foster told the conference in Belfast."The Irish language is spoken and enjoyed by thousands of people in all parts of Northern Ireland, it does no damage to our unionism or the Union we cherish."I respect the Irish language and those who speak it, however, respect isn't a one-way street."Respect works both ways."'Blocking restoration'Mrs Foster said Sinn Féin needed to "respect our British culture"."For too long they have shown nothing but disdain and disrespect for the national flag, the Royal Family, the Armed Forces, British symbols, the constitutional reality and the very name of this country."Time is short and those in Sinn Féin blocking the restoration of local decision making need to decide whether they want to do business with us or have direct rule ministers in place."I still believe that devolution is the best way to govern Northern Ireland, but to do that in a way that delivers for all of our people we need serious partners in government."On Brexit, Mrs Foster said it was "perhaps the most substantial and complex process the government and parliament had undertaken in the modern political era".She reiterated her desire to find a solution for Northern Ireland that would not harm the country's economic relationship with either the rest of the UK or the Republic of Ireland."As we joined the then European Community as one nation we will leave as one United Kingdom," she said.Responding to Mrs Foster's address, Sinn Féin's Stormont leader, Michelle O'Neill said she and her party "remained committed to making the institutions work," but said: "They must operate on the basis agreed 20 years ago.""A majority of citizens in the north expect and are entitled to the same rights enjoyed by citizens across these islands; language and marriage equality rights, due process in all aspects of the legal and judicial system, including inquests."DeadlockEarlier, the party's deputy leader Nigel Dodds told the conference that the deal with the Conservative Party was "in the national interest" and an opportunity for Northern Ireland."Our interests in the negotiations were not in seats for ourselves at the cabinet table but in jobs and investment for our people," he said."Our goal is not to push some narrow DUP agenda but to deliver for the whole community in Northern Ireland," he added.Image copyright Press Eye Image caption Nigel Dodds said that the time is coming when direct rule will be "the lesser of two evils"The Conservative Party are represented at the conference through senior minister Damian Green and chief whip Julian Smith, who is due to give a keynote speech on Saturday afternoon.Mr Dodds also addressed the ongoing political deadlock at Stormont.Mr Dodds said Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire must soon consider implementing direct rule if no deal is struck."While we understand, because of the talks process and the absence of ministers, things have been more difficult, within a very short space of time that will not be a tenable excuse for not taking action," he said."None of us want to see direct rule introduced but we are fast approaching the moment when it will be the lesser of two evils."
Michael Matheson urged to 'get a grip' of Police Scotland
The justice secretary denies he needs to step in amid claims of misconduct at the top of Police Scotland.
Image caption Michael Matheson said now was not the time for politicians to control operational policingThe justice secretary has denied he needs to "get a grip" of Police Scotland amid claims of misconduct about officers at the top of the force.Michael Matheson said now was not the time for politicians to start controlling day-to-day policing.It follows unrelated allegations of gross misconduct against officers, including Chief Constable Phil Gormley and his assistant Bernard Higgins.The Tories said the claims prompted serious questions about the force.Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins was suspended with immediate effect by the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) on Friday afternoon.'Special leave'Three other officers have also been suspended and two have been placed on restricted duties.The independent police watchdog is investigating allegations of criminal conduct and gross misconduct.The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) is also looking into allegations of misconduct against Chief Constable Phil Gormley, who is currently on "special leave".That investigation is unrelated to inquiries into allegations that officers in the former counter-corruption unit abused their position when attempting to find the source of a journalist's information.Both Mr Gormley and Mr Higgins have denied wrongdoing.Image caption ACC Bernard Higgins was suspended on Friday afternoonPolice Scotland has also faced criticism over its call-handling systems, with a review by Pirc uncovering a number of failings in the way police dealt with some 999 calls.The Scottish Conservative spokesman on justice, Liam Kerr, told BBC Radio Scotland: "This is a time of great challenge as well as great change for the force."The Scottish government is pressing ahead with the merger of the BTP (British Transport Police) and I think people will rightly wonder if this is really the context to be doing such major events as this and pressing ahead with it."Mr Kerr said the timing of the merger, given the flurry of allegations, should be questioned.'Politically smashed together'He added: "The conspicuous absences of the justice secretary - my view would be that he's got to step out of the shadows and get a grip on this because it keeps happening on his watch."The justice secretary is responsible for this. The justice secretary has to be coming out and saying 'there is a problem. We politically smashed together the single force and we are going to take responsibility for making it work', and frankly that is just not what's happening."Michael Matheson denied it was up to politicians to take over operational matters within the police.He said: "This is now a live investigation, which has been taken forward by Pirc. Allow that process to be taken forward."'Controlling policing'Mr Matheson insisted there was an "extensive team" at the top of Police Scotland which would make sure a "first-class service" continued to be delivered on a daily basis.He added: "It's important to recognise that the operational matters are the responsibility of the deputy chief constable and it's important that they are given the space to direct and take that forward in a way that they think is appropriate."Now is not the time for politicians to start controlling policing and that's simply not the way that policing has ever been delivered in this country."What we do is provide them with the support and assistance that they require and that's exactly what we are doing - making sure that the service get the assistance that they require financially."That's exactly what we're doing, unlike the Conservative government in London who have been taking that money out of the organisation for the last four and a half years."

Shillingford village car park fence causes row
A row erupts over a fence to stop cars parking on the grass of a village green
Image caption The trustees put in a metal fence and gate to "protect the village green as a traffic free area"A "bonkers" row has erupted over a small village car park after a frustrated community group erected a fence down the middle of it."Gobsmacked" parish councillors in Shillingford, Devon, were accused of parking on the village green which sits on the edge of the paved area.In a letter the trustees said their warnings about doing so went unheeded.The group did not comment to the BBC about its decision to build the fence.A local landowner handed the green, which sits behind the village hall, to Shillingford in the year 2000 and its care was given to the eight trustees.'Vindictive'The parish council said cars had parked on the grass "a couple of times" and there was no consultation on the fence.Chris Carr, council chairman, said he and his colleagues were "gobsmacked" when they saw the metal barrier and gate."We could not believe it," he said."It just seems very vindictive and unfortunate."'Vehicular traffic encroachment'The council has written to the trustees saying that the fence "significantly restricts the free access of the parish" to the green.In their letter, the trustees said they had warned councillors "on several occasions" parking was not allowed on the green.Image caption The fence cuts across the paved area of the green's car parkThey referred to an ultimatum which stated the barrier would be fenced if "further vehicular traffic encroachment occurred"."Unfortunately our concerns and warnings were not heeded," they wrote.They said the fence was erected to "protect the village green as a traffic-free area"Villagers are collecting signatures for a petition against the move which it will present to the trustees.Mr Carr said most villagers supported the parish council and he was "hopeful the issue can be resolved"."We cannot have a fence through the car park and it has to be removed."

'Sadistic' couple jailed for campaign of child abuse
Two boys were beaten, force fed, made to take scalding showers, and stopped from using the toilet.
Image copyright TVP Image caption Lisa Pratt and Andrew Clent were found guilty of two counts child crueltyA couple found guilty of the "physical, mental and emotional abuse" of two boys have been jailed.Lisa Pratt, 36, and Andrew Clent, 30, were both convicted of two counts of child cruelty in Witney between January 2010 and April 2015.The court heard how the children were beaten, force fed, and made to take scalding hot showers.A jury at Oxford Crown Court also found Pratt guilty of inflicting actual bodily harm on another teenager.She was described as having carried out most of the abuse and was jailed for seven years, while Clent was given four.Prosecutor Jane Brady said the children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, "were subjected to very cruel acts on a frequent, if not daily, basis".'Abominable and sadistic'She said one of the boys was throttled with a towel until "everything went black", and on another occasion had his head held underwater.The barrister said they were sometimes prevented from using the toilet and ended up soiling themselves, and were not allowed to have friends.When social workers came round the pair were told "if they didn't put on a show of everything being fine they would be punished", Miss Brady said.The abuse came to light after neighbours witnessed a third teenager being held down and repeatedly kicked and stamped on in April 2015.Judge Zoe Smith said Clent was different when his partner was not around, and might have been scared of her, but did not do anything to protect the children.Sentencing them she said their treatment of the two boys had been "abominable" and "sadistic".
Pullman's plea to save school libraries
Philip Pullman, and scores of other authors, urge the education secretary to protect school libraries in England.
Image copyright Getty ImagesChildren's authors such as Philip Pullman and Malorie Blackman are calling for a halt to the "shocking decline" in England's school libraries.They, along with 148 others, wrote to Education Secretary Justine Greening, asking her to signal her belief in the "value of literacy" for learning.She is being urged to set up a national service and to safeguard the positions of qualified librarians in schools.The government said spending on libraries was decided by schools.A recent survey suggests more than a quarter of schools have no librarian.The letter is signed by many of the big names in children's literature, including former children's laureate Chris Riddell, Roger McGough, Frank Cottrell-Boyce, and historical writer Lady Antonia Fraser.'Urgent need'It says: "Since 2008, the provision of adequately staffed libraries in schools and colleges with up-to-date learning and reading resources has declined sharply."Before they can read to learn, children and young people must first learn to read, to research and successfully to navigate today's information-rich world."As the situation stands in England, whereas the provision of appropriately staffed public and prison libraries is statutory on local government and HM Prisons Service, the provision of school and college libraries is not."Image copyright AlamyThe letter adds that Ofsted is considering guidelines for inspectors to consider how schools and colleges access the support of a trained librarian."However, the urgent need is with us now - we must act now to counter the loss of school and college libraries before we consign a generation to a lifetime of low attainment and mobility," it says.The letter highlights how England has lower rates of teenage literacy than other developed nations, according to international rankings.And it claims there is a general decline in the number of books issued to children, adding there has not been a related increase in electronic books.Ministers say they want all children to have the opportunity to read widely."School libraries play a role in this and schools are responsible for deciding how to provide this service for their pupils," said a Department for Education representative."We have introduced the National Funding Formula from 2018-19, backed by £1.3bn of additional investment, which will put an end to historic funding disparities in the system and provide significant gains for underfunded schools of up to 3% per pupil in 2018-19 and a further 3% in 2019-20."We leave it up to schools to spend their funding as they see fit."
Lush sorry for boarding doorway where homeless slept
The Green Party says it was "cruel" to board up entrances to empty shops where homeless people slept.
Image caption Lush said the boards outside the entrance to its empty shop on Cornmarket Street would be removed immediatelyCosmetics retailer Lush has apologised for boarding up one of its stores amid criticism it would stop homeless people sleeping in the doorway.Boards were placed outside Lush and Next in Oxford's Cornmarket Street after the retailers moved out.David Thomas, leader of the city council's Green Party group, said the move was "heartless".Lush said it was "an error", while the landlord of the Next building said homeless people were not targeted.Mr Thomas said: "The landlords of these premises should be ashamed of themselves."No-one would argue that sleeping in a doorway is ideal, but these men and women at the moment have no alternative."Image caption Jesus College owns the Next premises but said homeless people had not been targetedLush said the hoarding was put up following an email from Oxford City Centre Management which said a large number of complaints were being received about homeless people setting up camp in the doorway.The company said the message informed Lush it was responsible for the premises until its lease runs out in January.However, Oxford City Council has said "neither Lush nor Jesus College" were instructed to board up their doorways.Tim Sadler, council executive director, said it spoke to Lush and Jesus College about "serious concerns raised by members of the public about drug taking and used needles being found on their private land".He said they suggested taking injunctions out against individuals committing the offences "to stop them from taking drugs or discarding needles on the organisations' property".David Stevenson, property manager at Jesus College, a University of Oxford college which owns the Next building, said the boarding was "not a deliberate attempt to get at" homeless people."That's not what we had in mind." he added.Lush apologised to homeless people in Oxford and said the hoarding would be removed.

Brexit: Extra customs checks at ports could take place 'inland'
Britain's ports may have to build new facilities, a senior customs official tells MPs.
Image copyright PANew customs checkpoints may need to be built "inland" at British ports to handle the increased workload after Brexit, a senior official has said.Karen Wheeler said new infrastructure would be needed to "facilitate" customs controls and it would be up to ports to decide where to locate them.But space was tight at some ports so they might have be inland, she added.Labour's Meg Hillier said this "revelation" would be alarming news for cash-strapped councils in port towns.Ministers say they do not want to see major changes to the UK's customs or immigration procedures in the immediate aftermath of the UK's exit - scheduled for 29 March 2019.The UK is expected to leave the single market and customs union, but existing free movement rules could continue, in practice, as part of any transition agreement.'Not realistic'The government also hopes to negotiate a bespoke customs deal to ensure trade remains as frictionless as possible.But critics have been warned of chaos if the UK and EU are not able to agree an overall Brexit deal, with queues of lorries at ports and even food shortages. They say millions will need to be spent to prepare ports for such an eventuality.Ms Wheeler - director general of borders at Revenue and Customs - she did not anticipate immediate upheaval in the event of a "no deal" scenario.But she suggested more physical checks would be required in the long-run and that new facilities would have to be built at British ports to accommodate them."The assumption is that there, at some point, will be a need for some additional physical infrastructure to enable customs controls."As much as possible, we would like it to be inland rather than at the port, particularly where ports are constrained," she told MPs on the public accounts committee."There would need to be a process of establishing and identifying new inland facilities..That is what the ports would need to look at, along with HMRC, to consider what type of location may be appropriate."Asked whether the new facilities would be in place in time for the UK's exit, she said this was "not realistic" but officials would have a clearer idea of what would be needed by next Spring.Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said local councils, in places like Plymouth, Holyhead or Dover, were facing real financial challenges and would be potentially be alarmed at this "new revelation".
Tonia Couch: three-time Olympian to take up coaching role after retirement
Three-time Olympian Tonia Couch rules out a medal bid at next year's Commonwealth Games and announces her retirement from diving.
Tonia Couch finished seventh in the synchronised 10m at the World Championships in July with partner Lois ToulsonThree-time Olympian Tonia Couch has announced her retirement from diving, after a 12-year senior career.Couch, 28, is one of Britain's most decorated female divers having won silver at Glasgow's Commonwealth Games in 2014 and three European medals.She last competed at the World Championships in July, but will now take up a coaching role in her home city of Plymouth."I've achieved more than I ever could have imagined," she told BBC Sport.She will leave a lasting legacy in the diving world Tom Daley Double World ChampionCouch made her major international debut at the 2005 World Championships in Montreal when she was just 16, before going on to finish fourth at the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia, 12 months later.She sees reaching the Beijing 2008 individual 10m platform final in her Olympic debut as one of her career highlights, while she also finished fifth in the synchronised events at London 2012 and Rio 2016.Diving - fully-clothed - into the London Olympic pool with the entire GB team to celebrate Tom Daley's dramatic bronze was another stand-out moment for her."Even though it was someone else winning the medal it felt like we all won it," said the 2012 European champion."Tom's been one of my best friends for years and unfortunately his dad [Rob, who passed away in 2011] couldn't be there, so it was emotional and I felt so lucky to be there with him."Fellow Plymouth-born diver Daley has spent his entire career on the GB team with Couch and in February the pair finally competed together in the 10m mixed synchronised diving event at the National Cup.Tom Daley and Tonia Couch, here in 2015, have been friends for years and competed together in February"Tonia has been my best friend in diving for as long as I can remember and I'm going to miss my best friend coming on trips with me," Daley told BBC Sport."She is the most successful British female diver I have ever known and she will leave a lasting legacy in the diving world."Couch admits the departure of long-term Plymouth Diving head coach and mentor Andy Banks in May was "tough" for her to accept, but that there were other factors behind her decision to step away from competition."I haven't enjoyed training as much as I thought I would after the Olympics and it was hard to motivate myself when I'm 10 years or more older than everyone else," said Couch."British Diving is in such a great place now though and I'm looking forward to helping develop some of the young talent by teaching them about my experiences at the top."It's so special to have that chance here in Plymouth."Banks, who is now coaching the Australian national team, says it was a "privilege" to work with her during a "prolific" 18-year career and is delighted to see Couch remain in her home city."Having someone with her knowledge and experience is a great coup for the Plymouth programme and bodes well for the continued success of one of the very best diving centres in the UK," he told BBC Sport.Couch is due to marry fiancé and Royal Marine Karl Thurgood in November next year and says she is also looking forward to potentially starting a family in the coming years.
South West Ambulance staff call for trust boss to resign

Image caption An open letter calls for chief executive of the South West Ambulance Service to resignAmbulance staff have called for their boss to quit as they "struggle to maintain a crumbling service".GMB union members from South West Ambulance Service (SWASFT) have written a letter "apologising" to the public for "potentially putting them at risk".They have told chief executive Ken Wenman government cuts have led to "despair and frustration" among staff.Mr Wenman said SWASFT was working to "improve resource levels" and "urged" GMB to "re-engage and talk to us".He has not commented publicly on the call for him to resign.The open letter was addressed as an "apology to our families, friends and the community".To the public, they said they were "sorry for not getting to you or your loved ones quick enough because there are just not enough of us".They also apologised to family and friends for times when they missed "yet another family occasion".They also wrote that they felt "unsupported" by their employer SWASFT.Analysis by Matthew Hill, BBC West health correspondentThis dispute is all about changes to rotas as well as concern from members that they are having to work for longer than their usual 12-hour shift.But it must be remembered the GMB is not recognised by SWASFT, and part of their mission is to recruit more members to take them above the 25% figure that would help that come about.Having said that, the main union Unison is also concerned about work load, especially with the extra demands on their service due to problems with the out of hours service in Somerset, and closure at night of Weston A&E unit.But Unison has not gone as far as to call for any heads to roll.Gary Palmer, from the GMB, said: "We felt this recent letter on behalf of a group of GMB members particularly summoned up the general despair and frustration many staff currently feel from working within a service and role they love."Tony Fox, from SWASFT, said: "We accept that there is always more to be done and we will continue to work closely with our colleagues and listen and respond to their needs."The South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust covers Cornwall, Isles of Scilly, Devon, Dorset, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, Bristol, Somerset and South Gloucestershire.

The chatbot taking on Seattle's sex trade
Groundbreaking work in Seattle is using chatbot technology to disrupt a rampant sex trafficking problem.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Dave Lee's report from Seattle's red light districtIts creators say the bot is most effective when it poses as a 15-year-old girl.You can find "her" number within fake messages placed alongside real ads on websites popular with those looking to buy sex.Naive and innocent, the bot will tell you she is nervous and check that her age is "cool with you".If you say yes, that's when it's revealed: you've been talking to a chatbot, and buying sex is a crime that harms women the world over.It's a message designed to shock the recipient into reconsidering their actions, says Robert Beiser from Seattle Against Slavery."For someone who thinks they're anonymous, who thinks they can go on the internet and buy another human being, it's a big wake-up call."'Forgotten'The tool is part of groundbreaking efforts in Seattle to fight sex trafficking, an industry that like many others has moved online, and in doing so has become acutely difficult to prevent.Men no longer need to go to the dangerous and unpredictable red light district. Instead, these digital curb crawlers can buy women using a smartphone.It's a safer system, but only for the men."It was very violent," remembers Stephanie Harris, a former sex worker turned advocate for ending the trade.Image caption Stephanie Harris says she was left in hotel rooms for months on end"I had a quota that I had to meet every day. I stayed in hotels for months at a time, the same room."Those four walls... I remember having the TV playing just so there was noise. I remember sitting in there and thinking the whole world had forgotten about me."Using chatbots, and machine learning, specialists here believe they can simultaneously achieve two huge goals: deter men, and help women.'Mass exploitation'The internet has removed some of the psychological barriers and dangers of engaging with prostitutes."The growth of the internet has expanded the marketplace dramatically," says Val Richey, senior deputy prosecuting attorney for King County, a region that covers the city of Seattle."We found over 130 websites where you can buy sex in the Seattle area alone. One of those websites was averaging 34,000 ads a month last year."Our experience has been that there are hundreds and hundreds of people in our area being exploited, and we think there are up to 300-500 children being exploited at any one time."One effective way of tackling the crisis has been to re-insert those psychological barriers, forcing morality into the minds of men with a reminder that what they're trying to do is wrong.But this approach is extremely resource-intensive, often requiring specialists to engage one-on-one with the "John"."We know that there are thousands of buyers online at any time of the day or night," Mr Richey says."When we post a fake ad, we'll get 250 responses in the first two hours. There's no way that law enforcement has the capacity to respond to that."The chat bot allows us to connect with and deter all of those buyers online at any time. We've never been able to do that."Lifelike responsesThe challenge for developers was to make sure this chatbot was authentic. Any unusual behaviour, or nonsensical response, would tip off the target.Image caption Real Escape from the Sex Trade (Rest) offers support to women who want to leave prostitution behind"We work with survivors of trafficking to ask them how a conversation like this would go," explains Mr Beiser.It's the small touches that help here. Replies aren't instant. There is sloppy, bad English. It's by no means perfect, but during the bot's test phase earlier this year, 1,500 people interacted with the bot long enough to receive the deterrence message - a remarkable completion rate given the bot will ask for a selfie of the buyer as part of that conversation.As more people use the bot, the smarter it could potentially become. The project has the backing of Microsoft, one of the tech firms leading the way on natural language research.The bot isn't being used to arrest buyers, but that could be one application in future, Mr Beiser says.On AuroraThe second part of efforts here is about helping women get out of the life. To learn more about that, I visited Aurora Avenue. To an unknowing eye, it's not immediately obvious what happens here.But as Amanda Hightower begins pointing things out, the telltale signs are everywhere, such as the fast food restaurant that has pimps watching out onto the street keeping tabs on "their" women.Ms Hightower is executive director of Real Escape from the Sex Trade (Rest). The organisation's aim is to provide a safe and secure path for women looking to leave prostitution. Her work includes everything from giving women shoes and clothes, to driving to a location in the dead of night to pick up a woman who has sneaked out while their pimp was not around.Seattle's red light district looks precisely how you imagine - liquor stores, cheap motels and run-down car dealerships.As we wander up a couple of blocks, we see two women walking together. Ms Hightower asks us to point our cameras away so she can talk to them discreetly. The women listen, but only for a polite moment - they know speaking to Ms Hightower, an instantly recognisable figure with fire-red hair, could be dangerous.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A new anti-sex trafficking bill seeks to prosecute websites that encourage ads selling sexThese interactions, which used to be the main way of reaching trafficked women, are becoming more rare as fewer women use Aurora Avenue as a way to attract business.But online, the volume of ads is too overwhelming for an organisation like Rest to handle. And so, another piece of software has been developed, one that is able to spot known codewords and jargon used to evade pitifully dumb filters."We can use this software to scrape the phone numbers of the ads and send one mass text out to 200 women at one time," Ms Hightower tells me."If they're in a safe place, they can respond right away."Otherwise they can save the message and respond at a later time when it's safe to do so. It's actually made it easier for us to reach more victims of trafficking than it was before."In some cases women have contacted Rest months after the text message was sent out. In the past year, 40 women in Seattle have gone to Rest after being reached by the tool.A real solutionMs Hightower thinks the success of this technology could and should be replicated around the world, though she cautions that it's not enough to just contact women - there needs to be more investment in supporting them once they have left the life. The number-scraping tool has been rolled out to 12 cities and so far identified 90,000 unique phone numbers for specialists to contact.Advocates also back new legislation to clamp down on websites that facilitate the hosting of messages advertising the sale of sex.After a period of disagreement, and worries new laws might be too broad, the major technology companies have finally backed the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act - known as Sesta.It could mean the owners of Backpage.com, a site described by prosecutors as a "massive online brothel", could be held liable for the advertising that appears on their site. The site declined the BBC's request for comment.In the meantime, the work of Ms Hightower and others continues around the clock.She says: "Just yesterday I had a young woman, who's living in our residential programme, come up to me and she's like 'Amanda! I have a car, I have a licence, I have insurance! Like... insurance! Legit!'."Those are the moments that make it all worthwhile and seem less overwhelming, because we know we're making a difference."_____Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBCYou can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370

The early Christmas gift everyone's buying
How Advent has gone from chocolate treats for children to an extravagant present-filled bonanza.
Image copyright Marks&Spencer Image caption Marks and Spencer had a waiting list of more than 45,000 online customers for its 2017 calendarAdvent calendars used to be a cheap way to count down to Christmas with a seasonal picture or chocolate treat, but behind the doors you can now find everything from expensive whisky to fancy face cream. Are they a rip-off that represents the ever-growing commercialism of Christmas, or just a harmless bit of festive fun?"Christmas isn't like it used to be," is a familiar refrain. Yet even putting the rose-tinted spectacles aside, one element of the festive period - advent calendars - really have come a long way.There has long been a tradition in some Christian denominations to mark off the days of Advent, from lighting candles to the calendar's austere origins in 19th Century Germany when 24 chalk lines were rubbed off doors.But counting down to a festival marking the birth of Jesus has changed, from finding cheap chocolate behind the door of a pretty picture - a style popularised in the 1990s - to an extravagant present-filled bonanza boasting everything from pork scratchings to posh toiletries.Image copyright John Lewis Image caption Traditional card advent calendars are still popular, says John LewisThese bumper versions vary wildly in price, ranging from £10,000 for a rare whisky version, to a rather more modest cheese offering for £8 from Asda.But despite the sometimes eye-watering cost, some do represent value for money, according to MoneySavingExpert's Gary Caffell."If you want to give yourself a small daily treat of your favourite tipple, cheese or crisp, Advent calendars such as these are meant to be a bit of festive fun. So if that's why you're buying it and you're happy with the overall price, you may not be too fussed about the value you're getting behind each window.""Self-rewarding" is how consumer psychologist Kate Nightingale, founder of consultancy Style Psychology puts it.When you are rushing around trying to please everyone else, treating yourself to an early present is one way to cheer yourself up, she says.Chloe Haskoll, 34, says that is exactly why she bought a beauty advent calendar for herself this year."I'm not keen on chocolate and like the idea of a daily pick-me up. They're not cheap but I find December exhausting so it's a well deserved treat, I reckon," she says.Image copyright Chloe Haskoll Image caption Chloe Haskoll says her beauty calendar will be a "pick-me up" in a tough monthMr Caffell says beauty calendars tend to provide the best savings as they can be a cheaper way to buy a lot of products from one of the bigger brands, and any products you don't want can be given as stocking-fillers."Boots No7, M&S and Body Shop all have popular calendars which are worth looking out for, as you get products worth a lot more than the price of the Advent calendar itself."Natalie Oakley, who is behind beauty blog Lady Like Momma, has been known to stay up for the midnight launch of such calendars and tracks the launch dates in magazines and online."I choose a calendar based on two things," says the writer, from Sedgley in the West Midlands. "I either go for a brand I know and love already, or brands that I am keen to try out."And the second thing is the style [and] packaging. I think when you are spending quite a lot on a calendar you want it to look good in your home and I personally want to be able to use it again the following year and add my own things to the drawers."Image copyright Lady Like Momma Image caption Natalie Oakley reuses her beauty calendars by adding her own things to the drawersImage copyright Cadbury Image caption Cadbury launched its first Advent calendar in 1971, but only started producing them every Christmas from 1993Luxury calendars are a very recent phenomenon - department store Liberty's coveted beauty calendar, which sold out online in 39 hours this year, only launched in 2014.Even chocolate calendars only really became commonplace in the 1990s, says Alex Hutchinson, archivist and historian for Nestle."It wasn't until after World War Two and after rationing ended that chocolate became a more affordable purchase."Chocolate was so expensive that manufacturers couldn't afford to put it in an Advent calendar. By the 1960s, people got back into the habit of treating it as a grocery product but [the idea of chocolate being linked to Advent] would still have been a bit sacrilegious."You might also like:Cadbury's says the company launched its first Advent calendar in 1971, with production the following year and again between 1978 and 1980.It wasn't until 1993 the firm began to produce them continuously, when it became more routinely adopted as a Christmas tradition.But trying to marry the commercial desire to sell more during what is, after all, a religious festival, requires some sensitivity.When bakery chain Greggs promoted its advent calendar by swapping Jesus for a sausage roll in a nativity scene, some said it had gone too far.YouTube star Zoella also came a cropper when parents complained that her £50 12-window calendar was "overpriced tat", prompting Boots to halve the price to £25.Image copyright Greggs Image caption Greggs was forced to apologise for swapping Jesus for a sausage roll in its advent calendar promotionThere are other less obvious pitfalls for retailers.Those fiddly boxes and unusual shapes mean they can be difficult and expensive to make, something pork scratchings firm Snaffling Pig found to its cost when it launched its first calendar last year.The firm's founder Andy Allen says a combination of the A3 size, which took up almost all their warehouse space; and the need to produce the calendar in a short space of time to keep the product fresh, "almost broke them".The result was that they had less than a month to make and then post out 11,000 calendars before 1 December."It piled on a lot of pressure," he says.This year, they are making about 45,000 calendars and have outsourced the fiddly filling and calendar construction to a team."It is a bit more controlled," he says.Image copyright Daniel Jarvis Image caption Snaffling Pig struggled to make all its Advent calendars on time last yearFor larger firms like John Lewis, Advent is akin to a military operation.Head of Christmas products Dan Cooper has already picked his first set of calendars for next Christmas and across all styles, sales are up 48% so far this year.The chain launched its own £149 beauty product calendar for the first time this year, and the 3,000 it made have already sold out.Mr Cooper believes the growing popularity of more luxurious calendars is partly down to the ever earlier spread of "Christmas hysteria".But he says the real shift is that calendars have become "a family thing". Advent, it seems, is no longer just for kids.Image copyright John Lewis Image caption John Lewis says the Lego advent calendars are its strongest sellersAngus Thirlwell is the chief executive and founder of chocolate chain Hotel Chocolat, which has been selling a "posh calendar" pitched squarely at adults for nearly a decade now.He says people are generally buying calendars in addition to their usual Christmas gifts - not instead of them - and Advent has now become "a season in its own right"."That's why we like it," he says.But isn't festive commercialism getting a bit out of hand?"It's difficult to take the hedonism out of Christmas, the genie has already escaped the bottle," says Mr Thirlwell.Image copyright Eamonn M. McCormack Image caption Men outnumbered women by two to one in the queue to buy Liberty's calendar this yearRetailers, of course, say these calendars are a good deal - to the point of printing it on your receipt.In a clever marketing ploy. Marks & Spencer's beauty calendar (which is £35 if you spend an additional £35 on non-food products), flashes up at the till at £250, which is what the company says it's worth before the price is reduced.But customer reviews show they believe the chance to try more expensive products than they could normally afford makes them worth it.And glowing skin isn't necessarily the only bonus. Some calendars' popularity mean they can be lucrative.Liberty's £175 beauty calendars are now listed on auction site eBay at double the original price, for example.The idea that shops are deliberately under-stocking their calendars to create a fake rush is a "myth" according to Mr Cooper, who adds that changing trends mean "things sometimes sell better than expected".But however big your advent calendar is, and whatever you paid for it, there's still one big challenge left - stopping yourself from opening all those tempting little windows at once.
Australia knocks UK Brexit trade plan
The trade minister says splitting quotas of food imports could leave other countries out of pocket.
Image copyright AFP/Getty ImagesAustralia has criticised the UK's post-Brexit trade plans to split quotas of food imports from around the world.EU rules allow for a certain amount of goods to be brought in from countries outside of the Union without charging full tariffs.After Brexit, the UK and EU want to split these quotas, based on where the goods are mostly consumed.But Australian trade minister Steven Ciobo said it would impose unacceptable restrictions on their exports.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "The point is that you have a choice about where you place your quota at the moment."Therefore, given that you could put it in the UK or you could put it into continental Europe, why would we accept a proposition that would see a decline in the quota available because of the Brexit decision?"Dave Harrison, from Beef and Lamb New Zealand, agreed that its finances could be hit hard if they were not allowed to choose where to import more or less of their products.He told Today: "We understand that Brexit causes a lot of difficulties for the European governments, but we don't think third countries should have to take a hit in terms of their negotiated legal rights as a result of that."Shanker Singham, of The Legatum Institute, said the UK should talk to other countries about trade directly.He added: "We should be going to them and saying we have the ability - once we take up our chair at the WTO [World Trade Organisation] - to do trade agreements with you that will include a certain amount of liberalisation, depending on what you are prepared to give us."But if you damage us on the way to reclaiming our seat on the WTO, we are not going to be able to do those deals with you."The US, Brazil and Canada are also said to have their doubts about the new deal, believing it could hit them financially.A spokesman for the UK's Department of International Trade told Today the government wanted to minimise disruption to trading relationships and would engage with other members of the World Trade Organisation in an "open, inclusive way".Countryside impactMeanwhile, Tory MP Neil Parish, who chairs the environment, food and rural affairs committee in Parliament, raised concerns that if the UK's exports to the EU were hit post-Brexit and more imports were coming into the country from further afield, it could affect industries on our shores.Shadow international secretary of trade, Barry Gardiner, also said the wider implications could see an impact on the British countryside."As you affect farming, so you affect the way our country looks," he said. "That means you also affect the tourist trade."These are huge decisions that are being taken and we must protect our farmers to make sure that our countryside looks the way we want it to. "

Egypt attack: IS flags carried by gunmen, say officials
The death toll from Friday's bomb and gun attack on a mosque in Sinai rises to 305.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Egyptian military released footage of air strikes on "terrorist targets"Egyptian officials investigating the massacre of worshippers at a mosque in Sinai say the attackers were carrying the flag of the Islamic State group.At least 305 people died in the assault, which was launched during Friday prayers and has not yet been claimed by any group.Egypt's public prosecutor said there were up to 30 attackers at the scene.President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has vowed to respond with "the utmost force".The Egyptian military says it has already conducted air strikes on "terrorist" targets.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A man who survived the Egypt mosque attack says he saw between 10 and 20 people with weaponsEgyptian security forces have for years been fighting an Islamist insurgency in the Sinai peninsula, and militants affiliated with so-called Islamic State (IS) have been behind scores of deadly attacks in the desert region.Friday's attack in the town of Bir al-Abed is the country's deadliest in recent memory.Al-Rawda mosque was bombed and then dozens of gunmen, waiting outside, opened fire on those trying to escape. Some attackers wore masks and military-style uniforms.The assailants reportedly set parked vehicles on fire in the vicinity to block off access to the building, and fired on ambulances trying to help victims.Thirty children are among the dead and more than 100 people have been wounded.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ambulances were fired on"What is happening is an attempt to stop us from our efforts in the fight against terrorism," Mr Sisi said in a televised address hours after the attack."The armed forces and the police will avenge our martyrs and restore security and stability with the utmost force."Defying local dynamicsBy Dr HA Hellyer, regional expertWhat is particular about this attack is that this is not only the first on such a scale, but it was also carried out with such a lack of interest in local dynamics.Until now, radical groups have been trying to recruit in Egypt, from among local Egyptians.It is very difficult to see how that will be remotely possible following this attack - irrespective of local grievances vis-à-vis the state. If anything, this will only intensify local opposition to any group that claims the slightest bit of sympathy for attacks of this nature.Which militants operate in the area?Militant Islamists stepped up attacks in Sinai after Egypt's military overthrew Islamist President Mohammed Morsi following mass anti-government protests in July 2013.Hundreds of police, soldiers and civilians have been killed since then, mostly in attacks carried out by the Sinai Province group, which is affiliated to IS.Sinai Province has also carried out deadly attacks against Egypt's Coptic Christian minority elsewhere in the country, and said it was behind the bombing of a Russian plane carrying tourists in Sinai in 2015, killing 224 people on board.It has been operating mainly in North Sinai, which has been under a state of emergency since October 2014, when 33 security personnel were killed in an attack claimed by the group.Sinai Province is thought to want to take control of the Sinai peninsula in order to turn it into an Islamist province run by IS.

Tesla finishes installing mega-battery in Australia
The battery array can store enough energy to power 30,000 homes for about an hour.
Image copyright ReutersTesla has finished installing the world's biggest lithium-ion battery and will switch it on over the coming days.The 100-megawatt battery in South Australia is designed to provide security to the state's electricity grid.It will store enough energy to power 30,000 homes for about an hour.Tesla's chief executive Elon Musk had said the battery would be free if it was not installed within 100 days of signing a contract for the project.It appears the company will meet the 1 December deadline for installation of the battery array, which will be connected to a wind farm run by French renewable energy company Neoen.Image copyright ReutersNikkei Asian Review reports that the company used Samsung battery cells to get the work done.Mr Musk originally made the offer on Twitter after South Australia suffered a series of "load shedding" blackouts in February, as well as a state-wide blackout in September 2016 that left 1.7 million people without power.Load shedding blackouts occur when demand outstrips supply, and the Australian Energy Market Operator orders power companies to switch off electricity to customers to protect the grid.The state will have the right to use the battery array's entire output to avoid load shedding events.The project is part of a wider package of projects aimed at guaranteeing the energy delivery in the state, which is heavily dependent on renewable energy.Although it will undergo an initial testing phase, the battery array will provide "system security services" as soon as it is switched on."The world's largest lithium ion battery will be an important part of our energy mix, and it sends the clearest message that South Australia will be a leader renewable energy with battery storage," said the state's Premier, Jay Weatherill.
Burberry: How Christopher Bailey reinvented the brand with the chequered past
As Christopher Bailey leaves Burberry, we look at the legacy he's left for the fashion brand.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Burberry's classic check print was showcased at the London Fashion Week Spring/Summer 18 show.When Christopher Bailey arrived at Burberry back in 2001, he joined a brand that had mass appeal - but which was in danger of losing its credibility among the fashion set.He has been credited for transforming Burberry through show-stopping catwalk collections that are available to buy straight off the runway.Bailey has also drawn on the brand's British heritage, championing the UK's biggest models and musicians at Fashion Week and drawing the world's biggest names to experience it all on the front row.As the Yorkshire-born designer announces his departure from the company, we look back at the legacy he's left.Who could have predicted that one paparazzi shot could threaten the reputation of a huge luxury label?That's what happened in 2002, when EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook was photographed dressed head to toe in Burberry, with her daughter in a matching outfit.Fashion designer and retailer Alex Eagle tells the BBC that this was "the pivotal moment when the perception of the brand needed to change".Eagle says: "The print had been too overexposed and that image shows it became synonymous with ostentatious luxury."This came at a time when the brand had also become associated with the football world. Players' wives and girlfriends as well as fans famously donned the print during the 2002 World Cup.Burberry check also became ubiquitous with fake goods, meaning it had lost its exclusivity.Christopher Bailey helped change all that.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bailey accepted his Menswear Designer of the Year award at the British Fashion Awards in December 2013He joined the company 16-and-a-half years ago as a design director, working his way up to chief creative officer in 2014.Between 2002 and the present day, share prices have risen 729%.Eagle says Bailey, who is just 46, has managed to convince the fashionistas that Burberry is again cutting edge, exclusive and the only place to be during Fashion Week."I think he's a genius - he's created our best British global brand, it's young, desirable and cool," she says."Burberry previously was synonymous with bad taste.

It takes place in Kensington Gardens and is so grand. Celebrities fill the front rows and it's such an event."It's got such an uplifting feeling after a few days of shows and it has such a fun charm about it - they hold some of the best shows and parties."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jake Bugg played the Burberry Women's Fashion Week show in February 2016Felton also highlights another great factor Bailey brought to Burberry - the hottest music talent."Bailey's always supported British music too - he launched the careers of Jake Bugg and James Bay by having them play on his catwalks, which people don't know unless they're a fashion insider," she says.She adds that Burberry is also behind the phenomenon of the "it" bag - its Prorsum collection creates each season's most coveted possession, worn by celebrities and sold at a high price point to add to its desirability."His 'it' bag was a real turning point, he created the seasonal bag that everyone wanted."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Actress Mena Suvari was pictured in 2007 with her Burberry Knight "it" bagIt all started back in 2007 with the studded Knight bag, which was made as part of a limited run.It was a huge hit with celebrities, seen on stars like Cameron Diaz, Emma Watson and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley."I remember the Knight bag being four figures at the time and that was a big deal, it would cost £15,000 now," Felton says."Most big fashion houses do premium pieces anyway and Burberry knew what they were doing by uplifting prices."People will pay big money for amazing and limited pieces - they want an exclusive with only 20 items made."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Burberry's Spring Summer 17 show created a lot of interestBailey is also credited with creating ready-to-wear fashion, available to buy straight off the catwalk."He created catwalk to consumer and the ability to buy now," Eagle says."He avoided high street copies because he would exhibit his show and those items would be able to be bought in store there and then, rather than being in the store six months later.

Foxconn stops interns' illegal overtime at iPhone X factory
Apple's main iPhone supplier has stopped illegal overtime by school age interns in a factory in China
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Foxconn has faced several claims of poor treatment of workers at its Chinese factoriesFoxconn, a main supplier for Apple's iPhone, says it has stopped interns from working illegal overtime at its factory in China.It comes after a Financial Times report found at least six students worked 11-hour days at its iPhone X plant in Henan province.The practice breached Chinese laws preventing children from working more than 40 hours per week.About 3,000 students were reportedly hired to work at the Zhengzhou plant.Apple said the secondary school students worked voluntarily but they "should not have been allowed to work overtime".Both the tech giant and Foxconn have said the interns were "compensated and provided benefits"."Apple is dedicated to ensuring everyone in our supply chain is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve," the firm said in a statement."We know our work is never done and we'll continue to do all we can to make a positive impact and protect workers in our supply chain."The Foxconn Technology Group, which operates an internship programme at the Chinese factory, told the BBC in a statement that it took "immediate action to ensure that no interns are carrying out any overtime work".It added that "interns represent a very small percentage" of its workforce in China and that the breach of labour laws was inconsistent with its own policies.The Taiwanese firm reportedly hired the students in September to keep up with demand for the new iPhone X, which Apple has described as being "off the charts".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Dave Lee gets hands on with the new iPhone XThe iPhone is critical to Apple's product line and makes up more than half of its revenue, with more than 46.6 million phones sold between July and September this year.Its latest model, the iPhone X, was launched on the 10 year anniversary of the iconic smartphone and is Apple's most expensive handset yet, retailing for £999.Apple and its suppliers have come under fire several times in recent years amid accusations that they have failed to protect workers at Chinese manufacturing facilities, where some allegedly lived in overcrowded factory dorms and worked excessive hours.
Facebook to expose Russian fake news pages
It will release a tool to let people see if they had followed now-deleted Russia-linked pages.
Image copyright Getty ImagesFacebook plans to let people see if they had "liked" pages created by "foreign actors" to spread propaganda during the US presidential election.The social network has previously said as many as 126 million Americans may have seen content uploaded by Russia-based agents over the past two years.It is building a tool to let people see whether they had followed now-deleted pages made by the Russia-based Internet Research Agency.The tool will be launched in December.The Internet Research Agency was behind hundreds of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts and posted thousands of politically-charged messages.Many of the pages such as Heart Of Texas, Being Patriotic and Secured Borders were designed to look like they were created by US citizens.Image copyright facebook Image caption Facebook hopes to launch the tool before the end of the yearIn November 2016, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said it was a "pretty crazy idea" to suggest misinformation spread on the social network influenced the US presidential election.Since then, the company has identified thousands of posts and paid advertisements placed by Russia-based operatives.It has been criticised for allowing propaganda and fake news to spread on its platform and taking too long to address the problem.Russia has repeatedly denied allegations that it attempted to influence the last US presidential election, in which Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton."It is important that people understand how foreign actors tried to sow division and mistrust using Facebook before and after the 2016 US election," Facebook said in a blog post."That's why, as we have discovered information, we have continually come forward to share it publicly and have provided it to congressional investigators."And it's also why we're building the tool we are announcing today."
get fully funded parental leave
Aviva, the UK's biggest insurer, says its new policy is one of the most family friendly in the UK.
Image copyright Getty ImagesThe UK's largest insurer will allow all new parents the same amount of paid leave after the arrival of a child.Aviva will offer its 16,000 employees 26 weeks leave on full basic pay, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation.The policy applies to parents who have given birth, adopted or chosen surrogacy.But the industry body for personnel managers, the CIPD, said men's take-up of shared parental leave remained low.Nevertheless, the CIPD said Aviva's move was a significant and positive step.What are your rights?Most employed mothers are entitled to 52 weeks' maternity leaveStatutory maternity pay covers the first 39 weeks. It is usually paid at 90% of the mother's weekly wage for the first six weeks, with the remaining 33 weeks at £140.98 a week or 90% of their weekly wage, whichever is lowerEmployees may be entitled to shared parental leave within the first year of a child's birth or adoptionWomen who earn less than £112 a week are not eligible for statutory maternity pay; instead most can claim maternity allowanceFathers may be entitled to one or two weeks paid paternity leaveThe move tackles one of the barriers to career progression, Aviva says.Aviva argues the move will create a "level playing field for men and women" who want to take time out of their career to spend time with their family.The CIPD's spokeswoman welcomed Aviva's move increase the pay available "to allow both parents to play an equal part in the upbringing of their child".Aviva would need to use male role models to show it is acceptable to take up the offer of parental leave, "to encourage a change in perceptions and foster a cultural change. Otherwise, male employees may still be reticent about taking time off, even if paid," she added.Fathers often take a minimum amount of time off for financial reasons, whilst their partner's income is reduced.Image copyright Getty ImagesThe UK's provision for new mothers is among the worst in Europe, the TUC said earlier this year.The trade union body says only Ireland and Slovakia have worse "decently paid" entitlements, which it defines as two-thirds of a woman's salary - or more than £840 a month.Croatia offers six months leave; Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have more than four months; Estonia, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Denmark, France, Malta, and Switzerland offer more than three months.Aviva will offer nearly double the EU minimum requirement of 14 weeks, by giving 26 weeks leave at full basic pay for each parent within 12 months of a child's arrival.Aviva's new policy was devised by Sarah Morris, its chief people officer and a member of the company's executive committee.She is also on the steering committee of the 30% Club, which campaigns for greater representation of women on the boards of Britain's biggest companies.The insurer's policy is not the most generous in the corporate world, however. In August 2015 Netflix announced an unlimited leave policy allowing new parents to take as much time off as they want during the first year with their new child.
Facebook, Google and start-ups oppose net neutrality U-turn
Opponents say the proposed changes could threaten the US's start-up ecosystem.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption FCC chairman Ajit Pai was appointed by President Trump shortly after he won the electionTechnology giants Google and Facebook have joined forces with start-ups to criticise US plans to alter net neutrality rules.The principle that all internet traffic should be treated equally was enshrined in US law in 2015.But telecom companies complained an overly regulated net stifled innovation, particularly their ability to roll out broadband services.Regulators will vote in December on whether to overturn the rules.The changes have been proposed by the Federal Communications Commission, whose chairman Ajit Pai was a fierce critic of the Obama-era changes.Facebook said: "We are disappointed that the proposal announced this week by the FCC fails to maintain the strong net neutrality protections that will ensure the internet remains open for everyone."We will work with all stakeholders committed to this principle."In its statement, Google said the current rules "are working well".Meanwhile, content giant Netflix tweeted: "This current draft order hasn't been officially voted, so we're lodging our opposition publicly and loudly now."And, in an open letter to the FCC, a group, made up of 1,000 small businesses from around the US, wrote: "The success of America's start-up ecosystem depends on more than improved broadband speeds."We also depend on an open internet - including enforceable net neutrality rules that ensure big cable companies can't discriminate against people like us."We're deeply concerned with your intention to undo the existing legal framework."Without net neutrality, the incumbents who provide access to the internet would be able to pick winners or losers in the market."They could impede traffic from our services in order to favour their own services or established competitors."The FCC asked the public to contribute to the debate around the rule changes and received a record 22 million responses.But, in a press conference after it announced plans to change the rules, it said there had been many spam entries and therefore it had not taken the quantity of comments into account.Telecoms companies, for their part, have said they would not use the rule change to start charging some content providers more for access to consumers.In a blog post, ComCast's chief diversity officer wrote: "Comcast has already made net neutrality promises to our customers, and we will continue to follow those standards, regardless of the regulations in place."
Russian Fancy Bear hackers' UK link revealed
When notorious Russian hackers hired servers from a UK-registered company, they left a trove of clues.
Image caption Russian hackers spent well over $6,000 at CrookserversWhen Russia's most notorious hackers hired servers from a UK-registered company, they left a trove of clues behind, the BBC has discovered.The hackers used the computers to attack the German parliament, hijack traffic meant for a Nigerian government website and target Apple devices.The company, Crookservers, had claimed to be based in Oldham for a time.It says it acted swiftly to eject the hacking team - dubbed Fancy Bear - as soon as it learned of the problem.Technical and financial records from Crookservers seen by the BBC suggest Fancy Bear had access to significant funds and made use of online financial services, some of which were later closed in anti-money laundering operations.Fancy Bear - also known as APT28, Sofacy, Iron Twilight and Pawn Storm - has been linked to Russian intelligence.Image copyright Crowdstrike Image caption Some of Fancy Bear's activities had previously been identified by the cyber-security company CrowdstrikeThe group played a key role in 2016's attack on the US's Democratic National Committee (DNC), according to security experts.Indeed an internet protocol (IP) address that once belonged to a dedicated server hired via Crookservers was discovered in malicious code used in the breachThe spies who came in for milkEarly in 2012, Crookservers claimed to be based at the same address as a newsagent's on an unassuming terraced road in Oldham, according to historical website registration records.Image caption More Coronation Street than Le Carre?But after a short period, the listing switched to Pakistan. The BBC has seen no evidence the shop or its employees knew how the address was being used or that Crookservers had any real connection to the newsagent's.Crookservers was what is known as a server reseller. It was an entirely online business. The computers it effectively sublet were owned by another company based in France and Canada.The BBC identified Crookservers's operator as Usman Ashraf.Social media and other online accounts suggest he was present in the Oldham area between 2010 and mid-2014. He now seems to be based in Pakistan.Mr Ashraf declined to record an interview, but provided detailed answers to questions via email.Despite his company's name, he denied knowing he had had hackers as customers."We never know how a client is using the server," he wrote.When in 2015 he had been alerted to the hackers, he said, he had acted swiftly to close their accounts.He said he had also carried out a "verification" process, culling 60-70% of the company's accounts he had suspected of being misused."There is 0% compromise on abusive usage," he said.Joining the dotsOver three years, Fancy Bear rented computers through Crookservers, covering its tracks using bogus identities, virtual private networks and hard-to-trace payment systems.Researchers at cyber-threat intelligence company Secureworks, who analysed information from Crookservers for the BBC, said it had helped them connect several Fancy Bear operations.Image caption Mike McLellan of Secureworks said the hackers employed poor tradecraftSenior security researcher Mike McLellan said the hackers had exhibited poor "tradecraft".One communication shows one hacker, using the pseudonym Roman Brecesku, had complained that his server had been "cracked".Image caption A Fancy Bear hacker, using a pseudonym, complained that his server had been hackedCrookservers was previously linked to an attack on the German parliament.The server used to control the malware was hired through Crookservers by a hacker using the pseudonym Nikolay Mladenov who paid using Bitcoin and Perfect Money, according to records seen by the BBC.The hacker used the server until June 2015, when it was deleted at Crookservers's request following media reports of the attack.This server's IP address also appears in malware used to target some attendees at the Farnborough air show in 2014.Fancy Bear malware used to attack a UK TV station and the DNC also contained this IP address, although the server was no longer in Fancy Bear's control when these attacks occurred.A financial account used by Mladenov was also used by another hacker, operating under the pseudonym Klaus Werner, to hire more computers through Crookservers.One server hired by Werner received "redirected" traffic from a legitimate Nigerian government website, according to Secureworks analysis.Apple attackThe financial account used by Mladenov and Werner was used by Fancy Bear hackers - including two using the names Bruno Labrousse and Roman Brecesku - to hire other servers from Crookservers.One server and the email address used to hire it seem to have links to "advanced espionage" malware used to target iOS devices.The malware was capable of turning on voice recording and stealing text messages.Another email used to hire servers can be linked to an attack against Bulgaria's State Agency for National Security.But there are eight dedicated servers tied to the same financial information, whose use is unknown - suggesting there may be other Fancy Bear attacks that have not been publicly disclosed.Follow the moneyFancy Bear spent at least $6,000 (£4,534) with Crookservers via a variety of services that offered an extra level of anonymity.They included Bitcoin, Liberty Reserve and Perfect Money. Liberty Reserve was later closed after an international money laundering investigation.Image caption Tom Robinson of Elliptic tracked the source of some Fancy Bear paymentsThe BBC asked a UK company called Elliptic, which specialises in identifying Bitcoin-related "illicit activity", to analyse Fancy Bear's Bitcoin payments.Lead investigator Tom Robinson said his team had identified the wallet that had been the source of these funds. He said the bitcoins it contained were "worth around $100,000".Elliptic traced the source of some of the funds in that wallet to the digital currency exchange BTC-e.In July, BTC-e was closed by the US authorities and its Russian alleged founder arrested in Greece accused of money laundering.Although BTC-e is alleged to have been popular with Russian cyber-criminals, the BBC has no evidence its management was aware its clients included Fancy Bear.Continuing operationThe financial and technical records link together several attacks previously tied to Fancy Bear.And it is possible that following the financial trail further may yield additional revelations.Crookservers closed on 10 October. Fancy Bear's operations, however, have not.
Mitsubishi Materials shares fall on fake data scandal
Investors react after the Japanese conglomerate's materials subsidiary admits to falsifying data.
Image copyright Getty ImagesMitsubishi Materials, a division of one of Japan's biggest conglomerates, saw shares fall by as much 11% on Friday after admitting to a quality scandal.Three of its units were found to have falsified data for products supplied to nearly 300 companies in the aerospace, car and electric power industries.No safety issues have been reported.The discovery is the latest in a string of scandals tarnishing the image of corporate Japan and its reputation for precision manufacturing.Kobe Steel, Mitsubishi Motors, Nissan and Subaru all recently admitted to manipulating data. Several of them saw the quality lapses stretch on for decades.Mitsubishi Materials said it first became aware of the "misconduct" at its divisions in February and opened an investigation in the wake of the Kobe Steel scandal.Mitsubishi Materials has a 45% share in a copper tube joint venture with Kobe Steel, including the Hatano plant that is at the centre of the Kobe scandal.On Thursday Mitsubishi Materials apologised for the manipulation and promised to strengthen its quality control procedures to stop the problem being repeated.The firm said the impact of the quality scandal on its financial results "are currently unknown". It is scheduled to hold a press conference later on Friday.
Glitch in YouTube's tool for tracking obscene comments
A system for flagging indecent comments on children's videos was compromised by a serious glitch.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Children’s Commissioner for England says the comments are ‘very worrying’Part of YouTube's system for reporting sexualised comments left on children's videos has not been functioning correctly for more than a year, say volunteer moderators.They say there could be up to 100,000 predatory accounts leaving indecent comments on videos.A BBC Trending investigation has discovered a flaw in a tool that enables the public to report abuse.But YouTube says it reviews the "vast majority" of reports within 24 hours.It says it has no technical problems in its reporting mechanism and that it takes child abuse extremely seriously. On Wednesday, the company announced new measures to protect children on the site.Image copyright YouTube Image caption The form where YouTube users can report violationsUser reportsYouTube is the world's largest video-sharing site. In addition to algorithms that can automatically block illegal and exploitative videos, it relies on users to report illegal behaviour or content that goes against its rules. The company says it has a zero-tolerance policy against any form of grooming or child endangerment.Users can use an online form to report potentially predatory accounts, and they are then asked to include links to relevant videos and comments. The reports then go to moderators - YouTube employees who review the material and have the power to delete it.However, sources told Trending that after members of the public submitted information on the form, the associated links might be missing from the report. YouTube employees could see that a particular account had been reported, but had no way of knowing which specific comments were being flagged.Image copyright YouTube Image caption Highlighted: the flag icon on a YouTube account page which leads to a form where users can report violationsTrusted FlaggersBBC Trending was informed of the issue by members of YouTube's Trusted Flagger programme - a group that includes individuals, as well as some charities and law enforcement agencies. The programme began in 2012, and those involved have special tools to alert YouTube to potential violations.The company says reports of violations by Trusted Flaggers are accurate more than 90% of the time. The volunteers are not paid by YouTube, but do receive some perks such as invitations to conferences.With the help of a small group of Trusted Flaggers, Trending identified 28 comments directed at children that were clearly against the site's guidelines.Listen to BBC Trending radioThe comments are shocking. Some of them are extremely sexually explicit. Others include the phone numbers of adults, or requests for videos to fulfil sexual fetishes. They were left on YouTube videos posted by young children and they are exactly the kind of material that should be immediately removed under YouTube's own rules - and in many cases reported to the authorities.Image copyright YouTube Image caption Some of the comments found and reported on children's videos, which have now been deletedThe children in the videos appeared to be younger than 13 years old, the minimum age for registering an account on YouTube. The videos themselves did not have sexual themes, but showed children emulating their favourite YouTube stars by, for instance, reviewing toys or showing their "outfit of the day".The explicit comments on these videos were passed on to the company using its form to report child endangerment - the same form that is available to general users.Over a period of several weeks, five of the comments were deleted, but no action was taken against the remaining 23 until Trending contacted the company and provided a full list. All of the predatory accounts were then deleted within 24 hours.You might also be interested in:Members of the Trusted Flaggers programme told Trending that they felt their efforts in taking down such accounts and comments were not being fully supported by the company. They spoke, as a group, on condition of anonymity because of the nature of the work they do."We don't have access to the tools, technologies and resources a company like YouTube has or could potentially deploy," members of the programme told Trending. "So for example any tools we need, we create ourselves.""There are loads of things YouTube could be doing to reduce this sort of activity, fixing the reporting system to start with. But for example, we can't prevent predators from creating another account and have no indication when they do, so we can take action."New measuresYouTube has come under pressure recently because of the persistence of inappropriate and potentially illegal videos and other content on its site.BBC Trending previously reported on spoofs of popular cartoons which contain disturbing and inappropriate content not suitable for children. The site recently announced new restrictions on the "creepy" videos.Recent reports by The Times, Buzzfeed and other outlets have also highlighted disturbing videos both featuring children and targeted towards young people. And in August, Trending revealed a huge backlog of child endangerment reports made by the Trusted Flaggers themselves.Since then, the Trusted Flaggers who spoke to Trending say more attention is paid to their reports and that most of their reports are being dealt with in days. But in part because of the shortcomings in the public reporting system, the group estimates that there are "between 50,000 to 100,000 active predatory accounts still on the platform".Earlier in October, YouTube announced additional measures to crack down on disturbing videos and to protect children."In recent months, we've noticed a growing trend around content on YouTube that attempts to pass as family-friendly, but is clearly not," the company said in a blog post.The measures include increasing enforcement, terminating channels that might endanger children, and removing ads from some videos.The company also announced that starting this week it will disable commenting on videos of children that have attracted sexual or predatory comments.How to protect children onlineBe aware of what your children are doing on the internet.Pay particular attention to comments being made on videos and sudden spikes in popularity for content posted by children online.The NSPCC has a series of guidelines about keeping children safe onlineThey promote the acronym TEAM: Talk about staying safe online; Explore the online world together; Agree rules about what's OK and what's not; and Manage your family's settings and controls.There are more resources on the BBC Stay Safe site.In the UK, online grooming can be reported via the Click CEOP button.The Children's Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, described the findings as "very worrying"."This is a global platform and so the company need to ensure they have a global response. There needs to be a company-wide response that absolutely puts children protection as a number one priority, and has the people and mechanisms in place to ensure that no child has been put in an unsafe position while they using the platform."The National Crime Agency told Trending: "It is vital that online platforms used by children and young people have in place robust mechanisms and processes to prevent, identify and report sexual exploitation and abuse."YouTube responseA YouTube spokesperson said: "We receive hundreds of thousands of flags of content every day and the vast majority of content flagged for violating our guidelines is reviewed in 24 hours."Content that endangers children is abhorrent and unacceptable to us."We have systems in place to take swift action on this content with dedicated policy specialists reviewing and removing flagged material around the clock, and terminating the accounts of those that leave predatory comments outright."The company said that in the past week they've disabled comments on thousands of videos and shut down hundreds of accounts that have made predatory comments."We are committed to getting this right and recognise we need to do more, both through machine learning and by increasing human and technical resources."Reporting by Elizabeth Cassin and Anisa SubedarBlog by Mike WendlingAlso from Trending: The disturbing YouTube videos that are tricking childrenImage copyright CandyFamily/YouTubeThousands of videos on YouTube look like versions of popular cartoons but contain disturbing and inappropriate content not suitable for children.

Amazon workers on strike in Italy and Germany
Employees disrupt one of the retailer's busiest shopping days in disputes over pay and conditions.
Image copyright CGILHundreds of Amazon workers in Italy and Germany are on strike during one of the busiest shopping days of the year.Over 500 employees are carrying out their first ever strike at Amazon's warehouse in Piacenza near Milan over pay.Piazcenza is Amazon's main Italian hub, employing 4,000 people.Amazon said: "The vast majority of our employees in Italy and Germany came to work and remained focused on delivering the best customer experience."It added: "We are proud of our record of job creation and are confident we will deliver for our customers this holiday season."E-commerce is growing fast in Italy, but online sales account for only 10% of overall retail sales, according to consultancy EY, half the European average.The Verdi trade union said people are also striking at six warehouses in Germany over pay and working conditions.In a statement, Verdi board member Stefanie Nutzberger, said workers faced "high pressure to create more and more in less time, permanent performance controls and monitoring, [and] a poor leadership culture".Luigi Giove, Secretary General of Italy's CGIL union, said those on strike are calling for shifts which are "not exhausting" and for Amazon to redistribute its profits.
Uber takes driver battle to Supreme Court
The ride-hailing app wants the UK's top court to decide its appeal on drivers' employment status.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Two Uber drivers take opposing views on how the company should treat themUber plans to take its fight over the employment status of its UK drivers to the Supreme Court.Earlier this month the Employment Appeal Tribunal rejected the ride-hailing firm's argument about the status of employees.Unions argue that staff should be classified as "workers" rather than being self-employed.Such a move would entitle them to rights such as holiday pay and sick leave.Uber could have first taken the case to the Court of Appeal.An Uber spokesman said it had requested permission to appeal directly to the Supreme Court so that the case "can be resolved sooner rather than later".Drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam took a case to an employment tribunal last year, arguing they were Uber staff and entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage.After the Employment Appeal Tribunal upheld the original tribunal ruling, Uber UK's acting general manager Tom Elvidge said: "Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades, long before our app existed.Image copyright Getty Images"The tribunal relies on the assertion that drivers are required to take 80% of trips sent to them when logged into the app. As drivers who use Uber know, this has never been the case in the UK."Mr Elvidge said Uber had made changes to its app to give drivers more control, as well as offering illness and injury cover.Uber is also appealing against the decision by Transport for London not to renew its a licence to operate in the capital.The body ruled in September that Uber was not fit and proper to obtain a new private hire licence.The appeal process could take months, during which time Uber can continue to operate in London.

Penney all made modest gains.US retailers make up to 40% of their annual sales during the holiday season.Analysts and retailers said crowds at stores around the country this year were strong."Retail spending and online shopping news is looking good, spurring hopes for strong retail sales," said Peter Cardillo of First Standard Financial.US shoppers had spent more than $2.8bn online by Thanksgiving evening, a 17% jump over the same period last year, according to Adobe Analytics.However, Target ended 2.8% lower, with analysts noting that it closed its stores for several hours overnight while rivals stayed open.Meanwhile, US oil prices hit a two-year high as North American markets tightened on the partial closure of a key pipeline linking Canada and the US.
The Disruptors
Everything about how we spend, save and bank is being challenged. Will consumers have to pay a heavy price?
Meanwhile, technology is reinventing the very building blocks of our finances. As long ago as the 16th Century BC, goods were exchanged for a form of currency – cowrie shells.Later, in the 7th Century BC, coins were first minted in Lydia, in modern-day Turkey, from electrum – a natural alloy of gold and silver found in riverbeds.Much later, paper money was introduced in China. Known as “flying cash” owing to its convenience and lightness, it was backed by the central authority. According to Ben Alsop, curator of the Citi Money Gallery at the British Museum in London, that introduced a vital concept – trust.Trust of the authorities, and trust that this piece of paper was actually worth something. So, for years, currencies have traditionally been issued by governments via central banks.Now cryptocurrencies can be created and stored electronically on a completely decentralised system. More than 1,000 of them exist globally, the best-known of which is Bitcoin.All of which raises issues of control and influence. Who controls currency – governments or networks of computers? Who controls our payments – technology companies, payment card providers, or banks?Arguably most importantly of all, who controls all the data about our financial transactions – you or them?
China cuts import tariffs on almost 200 consumer goods
Import tariffs have been cut from 17.3% to 7.7% on a range of goods from whisky to cashmere clothing.
Image copyright AFP/Getty ImagesChina is cutting import tariffs on 187 consumer goods from whisky to cashmere clothing to help spur spending and economic growth.The Finance Ministry said tariffs will drop from an average 17.3% to 7.7% on products, including pharmaceuticals, food, health supplements and clothing.The cut will take effect from the beginning of December.The move is designed to encourage consumers to spend more at home rather than on trips overseas."On-going process"It is thought to be part of a shift towards creating a consumption-driven economy, and signalling to the world, especially the US, that it is opening up its economy.US President Donald Trump has long complained of unfair trade practices by China and wants to reduce America's deficit with the country.Domestically, there is increasing demand for foreign brands, especially after a number of food-safety scandals.Doug Lippoldt, chief trade economist at HSBC, said the cuts in the import tariffs were positive and part of an "on-going process" by the government."The reduction of import tariffs on clothing, dairy products, food and other consumer items mean domestic suppliers will have to become more competitive, which will benefit the Chinese economy and consumers in the long run."It would also help Chinese manufacturers if the government looked at the liberalisation of services, such as accountancy, telecoms and IT."I think trade partners in advanced economies will see this as a step in the right direction.""Welcome boost"China's move was welcomed by Scotch whisky producers, who will see their tariff fall from 10% to 5%.Rosemary Gallagher, from the Scotch Whisky Association, said China was an important market for the spirit."In the first six months of 2017, demand for Scotch in China jumped as the economy grew, with direct exports alone up 45% to £27m."A cut in tariffs will give another welcome boost to Scotch and should encourage the premium Scotch whisky market to continue to expand," she added.
The firms being creative with food destined for the bin
A growing number of businesses are finding creative uses for surplus food - but will the trend ever go mainstream?
Image copyright Twitter Image caption Bean & Wheat's pates, pickles and desserts are made with off-cuts and surplus fruit and vegA rising number of firms are finding creative uses for surplus food. But are consumers comfortable eating produce that would have otherwise ended up in the bin?On the surface there seems little that's different or unusual about Bean & Wheat, a deli and cafe hidden away in a cobbled alleyway close to Liverpool Street Station in London.But the food I'm tucking into - Kilner jars filled with delicious goods such as piccalilli and vegan chocolate mousse with a creamy tofu topping - has all been made from ingredients that would have otherwise been thrown away.Adam Handling launched Bean & Wheat in June to use surplus food from the kitchen of his nearby restaurant, The Frog E1.The Masterchef finalist wanted to help reduce the around 199,000 tonnes of food waste produced each year by British restaurants, which he feels not only harms the environment but also "wastes money".Bean & Wheat's dishes include salads made from unusual parts of vegetables, such as cauliflower stalks, pates made with off-cuts, and oils made with the tops of the herbs which are usually binned.Image copyright Adam Handling Image caption Adam Handling reuses surplus food from the kitchen at his restaurant, the Frog E1Mr Handling also makes his own compost from vegetable peelings, cold-pressed juices from misshapen fruit, and even soap with coffee grounds."One of my priorities is to minimise food waste at my restaurants to the point that we have hardly any," he says.Bean & Wheat is just one of a rising number of companies looking to tackle the issue of food waste, which sees a third of food produced for human consumption lost or wasted, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation. That's equivalent to 1.3 billion tonnes globally every year.The overproduction of food, rules restricting the sale of discoloured or "wonky" produce, and an aversion to leftovers, despite them being perfectly fine to eat, are all to blame.And campaigners say that not only is such waste morally wrong, it also wastes water and worsens global warming as swelling landfills emit more greenhouse gasses.Image copyright Astrid Templier Image caption Rubies in the Rubble condiments are made with "ugly" fruit and vegJenny Dawson Costa quit her job in the hedge fund industry in 2011 and launched Rubies in the Rubble, hoping to offer a "practical solution" to the problem.The British firm uses unwanted "ugly" fruit and veg from UK farms to make condiments, such as pink onion and chilli relish, banana ketchup and piccalilli. Its products are available in 500 stockists, including Waitrose, Selfridges and independent stores.Ms Dawson says that since she started, the public has become more aware about the issue of food waste and more open to eating surplus food."Many consumers used to be put off by it and were worried about the quality but I think that's changing. Brands like ours are also showing it can be used in products that taste great," she adds, noting that her firm has won several awards.Indeed, even major retailers are embracing the trend, with Tesco and Asda among those now stocking misshapen fruit and veg.More stories from the BBC's Business Brain series looking at interesting business topics from around the world:Image copyright Rubies in the Rubble Image caption Rubies in the Rubble's products are sold in Waitrose and SelfridgesOthers are taking a different approach to tackling the problem, such as Danish tech company Too Good To Go.It is one of a number of new apps that allow customers to buy unsold food from local restaurants, cafes and bakeries for knockdown prices.The firm works with more than 6,000 food businesses including Yo! Sushi and Exmouth Coffee Company, and operates in six countries including the UK, Sweden and Germany.Co-founder Chris Wilson says it has saved two million meals from the bin since its launch in June 2016, however the firm still has to fight against negative perceptions around surplus food."Whilst there's been a shift in the mentality of people, most people are sceptical - the vast majority of the UK still looks upon food waste as being scraps from people's plates. With us it's not that at all."Image copyright Too good to go Image caption Jamie Crummie and Chris Wilson co-founded Too good to goTrish Caddy, a food industry analyst at Mintel, also believes surplus food continues to be stigmatised."Consumers have high demands for companies to address food waste, but currently that does not translate to their own behaviour and it remains to be seen if the trend will go mainstream soon."She points to a Mintel survey, which found that 77% of those who eat out or buy takeaways agree that restaurants should be more committed to reducing food waste, but only 17% are interested in eating dishes made from food that was due to be thrown away.Of course, the hospitality industry will not be able tackle the problem of food waste alone.Manufacturers, retailers and most importantly households - the biggest producers of food waste - must all play their part, says UK charity the Waste & Resources Action Programme.However, Mr Handling says that every little helps and there are plenty of ways food businesses can contribute."They can incorporate more 'nose-to-tail' cooking, send anything that can't be cooked to be composted, or find another way to use off-cuts and by-products, or donate leftovers to charities as some restaurants and supermarkets do."It's about taking a second to think 'have I absolutely exhausted all possibilities with this ingredient?' before throwing it away."
How a speedy emergency services app is saving lives
Not every country has a single number to call in an emergency. One start-up is trying to change that.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How an emergency services app is helping to save livesMany of us assume that if you call an emergency number like 911, 999 or 112, someone will answer quickly and help will arrive soon wherever we are in the world.But across Africa, this isn't always the case.In Kenya's capital Nairobi, for example, there are more than 50 different numbers for emergency services. Ringing round trying to find an available crew can be a lengthy - and potentially life-jeopardising - process.You can wait two or three hours for an ambulance to arrive."You just take for granted that 911 [the US emergency services number] exists, and we did as well," says Caitlin Dolkart.She and her business partner Maria Rabinovich had both been working in the health industry in Nairobi for years before starting their company Flare."We thought - what would we do in an emergency? So we started asking people to spot ambulances and realised there were so many around and no one has any idea where they are," says Ms Dolkart.Image caption Flare co-founder Maria Rabinovich wants to improve emergency service response timesThe pair created an Uber-style online platform that aims to connect people to the closest emergency responders.Private ambulance crews log in to the system at the start of a shift. Their locations can then be tracked and monitored by any hospital registered to Flare."Within the system we have different ambulance companies, so depending on the resources we work together," says Patrick Kinyenje, who works as emergency co-ordinator or dispatcher at Care Hospital in Nairobi.Flare aggregates all the available ambulances on a map so dispatchers like Patrick can choose the most appropriate vehicle based on where it is, the expertise of the crew, and the equipment on board.It also incorporates Google maps traffic data to help emergency workers navigate the city's notorious traffic jams."The response time that we have seen has gone down from 162 minutes, which is the average, to about 15 to 20 minutes," says Ms Dolkart.Image caption Firefighters in Nairobi often have to tackle major traffic jams before tackling major firesHospitals pay a subscription fee to access the service whilst individuals in the capital can sign up for membership, with levels of cover starting from around $15 a year.The website promises access to a 24/7 hotline of emergency professionals."The membership product is like your emergency and healthcare concierge," says Ms Rabinovich.The service is similar to ones run by Red Cross Kenya, Amber Health in India and Murgency in Dubai.But will this business model really work in a country where $15 is three months salary for many people?Dr Stellah Bosire-Otieno of the Kenya Medical Association has her doubts."By principle it's an excellent idea. But the target population that can afford it are the middle income earners who most likely have health insurance."Those in the low social economic regions wouldn't be able to afford this," she says.In 2013, the government re-introduced a 999 emergency hotline number for the capital but it was inundated with prank calls and is now rarely answered.During the recent election violence, the BBC rang the number a few times but didn't get through. On one occasion, someone did pick up the phone, though hung up immediately."To be honest it rarely works," explains Bethuel Aliwa, who runs ICT Fire and Rescue, a training school and Fire service."Also, the technology of 999 has not changed, people have moved to mobile phone, but I believe 999 is still on analogue, so it is quite a problem," says Mr Aliwa.A 999 call goes direct to the police who then start looking for the nearest ambulance or fire engine. But there are dozens of numbers for the various emergency services, and often phone numbers belong to individuals rather than agencies.Image caption There are many different ambulance services competing for business"By the time a fire service arrives, it's often too late," says Mr Aliwa.Flare is now working on aggregating private fire agencies onto the system.Due to the nature of Nairobi's roads and the constant traffic jams, the crew at ICT have found that sending smaller fire trucks works better. The downside is they can carry less water.In addition, being a private agency, the places they can get water from are limited.More Technology of BusinessImage copyright Getty Images"Within five minutes the water is done, we need to rush to the nearest hydrant. You are gambling, you know, today you'll either get water or not," says Mr Aliwa.To solve this issue, Flare is mapping all the available water hydrants in the city and recording them on the platform. So in addition to available fire trucks, dispatchers can also identify the closest water points."When we first started to do the research on fire in Nairobi, we found there are up to 4,000 fire hydrants that are potentially working," explains Ms Rabinovich.Image copyright Flare Image caption During the Kenyan elections in October, Flare recorded a 33% increase in ambulance movements"But a lot of them are not in service. There are about eight that the firefighters currently use and know about, so there is a huge potential to improve fire response."Flare is currently working with the private sector with the intention of adding more "concierge-style" features for members, such as real-time updates and treatment information.The start-up is also collecting some interesting data."We learned there is a lack of ambulances between 7am and 9am because of shift handovers," explains Ms Dolkart."We're trying to encourage operators to stagger shift changes and make sure there is always an ambulance available," she says.Flare hopes the information they are collecting for both the fire and ambulance service will prove useful in coordinating better services across the city.
The female tech bosses who want zebras not unicorns
A new movement calls for tech investors to back more start-ups led by women and people from ethnic minorities.
Image copyright Tinsel Image caption Aniyia Williams is a co-founder of the so-called zebra movementZebras fix what unicorns break.That's the motto of a new movement in the tech industry frustrated by Silicon Valley's lust for so-called unicorn companies.A unicorn is a start-up valued at more than $1bn (£750m) - Facebook is a classic unicorn.The zebra movement was launched earlier this year by four female founders who struggled to find funding for their tech start-ups.The entrepreneurs wrote a manifesto calling for Silicon Valley to invest in more female and ethnic minority founders, and to back new companies from such backgrounds that want to be both profitable and improve society - zebras - instead of chasing mythical unicorns.Aniyia Williams is a co-founder of the zebra movement. She has also set up and runs San Francisco-based Tinsel, which makes necklaces with earphones concealed inside.She was tired of her headphones being tangled up and lost in the bottom of her bag, and imagined a better, more stylish way to wear her technology.Image copyright Tinsel Image caption Tinsel's headphones double as necklacesAniyia wanted headphones embedded inside a bold, statement necklace. She presumed such a product already existed - and was surprised when she searched online and couldn't find what she was wanted.So she decided she would create a luxury necklace that looked as good as it sounds.Her first product, The Dipper, is a bold, chevron-shaped pendant, which conceals the ear buds. It comes in gold and gunmetal and is one of those products that makes you wonder "why didn't I think of that?".And with the zebra movement Aniyia imagines a better, more inclusive world for female and minority founders.Her own experience was of a struggle to convince venture capitalists, known as VCs, about her idea."I pitched to over 100 investors, and at the end of the day I ended up landing two," says Aniyia, who has also invested personal money in her company."I think there are a lot of issues with how the VC model works. It favours a specific type of person over everyone else."I ask her whether she means white men. "You said it," she replies.Aniyia's first investor was her boss at voice communication app Voxer. She'd worked her way up from part-time office assistant to leadership roles, and was the head of a marketing team at the San Francisco-based company.When she told her boss, Tom Katis, about her idea for Tinsel - he loved it so much that he offered to help fund the company himself.Image copyright Ian J Whitmore Image caption Aniyia Williams spoke at the recent DazzleCon event in Portland, OregonHer other investor is Backstage Capital, which specifically funds companies started by women, ethnic minorities and LGBT founders who are often ignored by traditional venture capitalists.Less than 10% of all venture capital deals go to women, people of colour and LGBT founders, according to Backstage Capital.Aniyia, who is 32 and African American, says she thinks too many investors in Silicon Valley are missing opportunities to be part of profitable, sustainable companies because they're chasing things that aren't real - unicorns.Zebras by contrast, she says, are real. I meet Aniyia in Portland, Oregon at DazzleCon, the first gathering of the zebras, where founders and investors met in person to discuss business strategies and if nothing else, to realize they're not alone. Why the name? Well, in the wild a group of zebras is called a dazzle.Initially, Aniyia was swept up in the Silicon Valley ethos and planned to build a billion dollar company."I was trying to build the Apple for fashion tech," she says. "But I am not trying to build a billion dollar business. That's not even aligned with the lifestyle I want."Aniyia became pregnant as she was building her company and working with a team to design her stylish headphones.The reality of building a family and a company, and trying to raise money, made her realize she wanted a business that would be profitable and sustainable - not one with a billion-dollar price tag."It was a really challenging journey," she says. "I would say the parts around raising the money was the hardest."Image copyright Tinsel Image caption Ms Williams says she set up the business because no-one else was making the product she wanted to buyAniyia started the zebra movement with fellow entrepreneurs Jennifer Brandel, Mara Zepeda and Astrid Scholz. Aside from championing more inclusive business values, the women warn of the dangers of unicorn companies."When shareholder return trumps collective well-being, democracy itself is threatened. The reality is that business models breed behaviour, and at scale, that behaviour can lead to far-reaching, sometimes destructive outcomes," they wrote in their manifesto.Jennifer says unicorns become dangerous precisely because they grow too fast."I think a lot of companies have never had an opportunity to grow so fast as they can these days. And with that comes tremendous growing pains at the expense often of the person they're serving," she adds."We don't think that unicorns should not exist. We just think that we should exist as well."We're trying to point out that there are a lot of businesses that you're leaving out and a lot of amazing founders that you're leaving out."
Brazil's Neymar and the $6bn global trade in footballers
How a handful of countries on three different continents drive the international trade in playing talent.
Image copyright Getty ImagesFootball transfers were catapulted off the sports pages into the global media spotlight this year when Paris St-Germain broke - or rather smashed - the world record fee to snatch Brazilian star Neymar from Barcelona this summer.The French club paid an eye-watering 222m euros ($260m; £200m) for the player, more than doubling the previous record set when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United from Juventus for £89m in August 2016.But that very prominent deal was just the very visible peak of a huge industry, namely the international trade in football players, which is becoming more and more of a global business.Latest data from Fifa, the sport's governing body, show there have been 15,291 international transfers so far in 2017, with total spending on players hitting a record $6bn (£4.58bn).International transfers are ones where a player moves from one country to another, as opposed to domestic transfers which take place between two clubs in the same country.That record figure - which is unlikely to change by the end of the year as player transfer windows in the biggest European leagues are not due to open again until January 2018 - is a 25% increase on the $4.8bn spent in 2016.'Chinese spending'"There are two driving factors behind the soaring spending," says Harry Philp, a football finance expert at London-based Portland Advisers."The first is the emergence of China and the huge transfer fees that they are prepared to pay, and the second is the fees English Premier League clubs can spend thanks to their ever more lucrative TV deals. These factors are driving up the value of the global market."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Former Chelsea star Ramires is one of dozens of overseas stars now playing in ChinaIndeed, Chinese clubs spent a whopping $451m on football players last year, an increase of 168%. That made them the fifth biggest spenders in the world after England - where clubs splashed out $1.37bn on global stars - Germany, Italy, and Spain."The rapid nature of this [Chinese spending] growth is unprecedented," observes Fifa. "One of the key objectives fuelling China's transfer drive is to raise the overall standard of football in the country so as to assist the national team in reaching the World Cup for only the second time in their history, following their debut in 2002."There has been a huge increase in investment in Chinese football in recent years, kicked off by President Xi Jinping's plans to turn China into a great footballing nation, one that one day might host and ultimately win a World Cup.Way out of povertyChinese clubs are investing almost exclusively on players coming from Europe, but not necessarily Europeans.Many of those making a playing name for themselves in East Asia are South Americans, and Fifa's data shows Brazilians and Argentines are the most transferred nationalities globally.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Football is a potential way out of poverty for many young Brazilians"Irrespective of how their national team is doing, Brazil continues with its production line of young players for sale around the world," observes Mr Philp."It is a socio-economic phenomenon, with football still being a way out of the favelas and a means for a youngster to financially support his extended family."Not only does Brazil produce talented players for export, with their stars now plying their trade in 118 countries, but their total financial accumulated sales value came to $594m in 2016, the most for any playing nation.Free agentsMost of the transfers discussed in the global media involve large transfer fees, but in reality, only a small percentage of all worldwide transfers involve the payment of a fee.The majority of deals are players who have become free agents finding a new club."Transfers out of contract remain the most popular type of international transfer," says Fifa. They are even more common for older players - in 2016, more than 90% of the international "transfers" of players older than 32 were out of contract.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chelsea bought Croatian youngster Mario Pasalic (l) in 2014 and have loaned him to four clubsLoan deals account for another proportion of transfers, and there have been accusations that clubs such as Chelsea, and to a less extent Manchester City, are scouring the globe for top young talent to stockpile."They are then put out on loan to see how they develop," says Mr Philp. " A small proportion will make it into to the first team, and the rest of the pool of talent can be sold on, usually at profit. This provides revenues for the clubs to then buy one global top star player, and also to assist in compliance with financial fair play."These clubs are trading players, almost running what I would call 'asset-management businesses'."'Transfer madness'In such a fractured landscape it all means that transactions such as Neymar's, where money changes hands, are actually in the minority."It is at the top level where the fees are being paid," says Mr Philp. "A club like Paris St Germain is spending so much money that they are accounting for a meaningful percentage of annual global transfer revenues."He says that after splashing out 220m euros on Neymar, PSG is set to pay another 180m euros or so next year, when it makes permanent its current loan signing of Kylian Mbappe from Monaco. There have been suggestions that the Paris club has opted for a loan deal this year to get around financial fair play rules.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Television revenues are allowing Premier League clubs to keep spending large sums on top playersThe financial fair play rules have been introduced by European football's governing body Uefa to ensure that clubs only spend cash on big-name star signings from revenues that they have created, rather than through borrowing or handouts from rich owners."Financial fair play is meant to control the transfer madness," says Mr Philp. "But if revenues are going up, whether through TV monies in the Premier League, or at PSG via Qatari investment - however that is being structured - then transfer fees and player wages will continue to climb."Financial fair play is still alive and kicking, but with revenues soaring then there is nothing to stop the global transfer trade going the same way."With January transfer trading windows opening in the biggest five European leagues including England - as well as in China and Brazil - it means players, clubs and agents will already be gearing up for a frenzied period of global trading that could see spending leap even further ahead during 2018.
How an Icelandic firm became a global food giant
How an Icelandic firm called Marel became one of the world's largest manufacturers of food processing machinery.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The cod father of the global food productionHundreds of freshly caught cod are moving at pace down a conveyor belt, before automated paddles pop out to send the fish splashing, one by one, into storage tanks below.From there the cod, pulled from the cold water of the North Atlantic just a few hours earlier, enter a machine where the two sides or fillets of the fish are quickly removed.The raw fillets then go whizzing off on another conveyor belt, directed in places by 50 or so workers in white overalls and waterproof blue aprons, gloves and rubber boots.Another machine then takes just 1.2 seconds to cut each fillet into neat portions, and a few minutes later the cod is boxed up on ice, ready to be flown to cities across Europe and North America to be eaten that same day.This is the busy scene early one morning at a fish processing plant on the south coast of Iceland.Image caption Marel works with Icelandic fish processing firms to test its latest equipmentWe are there to see first hand the hi-tech assembly lines at work, which have been manufactured by an Icelandic company called Marel.Marel is a name that few people outside of Iceland have heard about, but it is one of the world's largest manufacturers of food processing machinery.Selling to food chain firms from Europe to China, and the US to Brazil, it has an annual turnover of $1bn (£760m).But how has a company from an isolated island just south of the Arctic Circle, and with a population of only 335,000, managed to become such a global leader in its field?Image caption The fishing sector accounts for almost a third of Iceland's economyMarel's chief executive, Arni Oddur Thordarson, says that the business aims to ensure that its machinery and computerised systems are more technologically advanced than its rivals."We invest 6% of our revenues on innovation, meaning we invested $60m last year in innovation," he says.The firm is also continuing with a policy of acquisitions around the world, buying up smaller rivals as a way to increase its market share.Marel was founded as a private company back in 1983 following a project at the University of Iceland to devise ways to help the country's vital fisheries sector boost production and improve efficiency.Image caption Arni Oddur Thordarson leads a global workforce of 5,000 peopleAs catching and processing fish accounts for almost a third of Iceland's economy, protecting and boosting the industry is a vital national concern.So the idea behind Marel was to increase the mechanisation of the fish processing, so that the fish could be filleted and packed more quickly and efficiently - maximising the amount of meat that could be neatly removed from the cod, salmon and other species.Like any Icelandic firm with ambitions to grow, Marel realised it had to quickly expand overseas because its home market is so small. Within two years it was selling its equipment to Canada and a year later to the then USSR, today's Russia.By the 1990s Marel (the name comes from a combination of "marine" and "electronic") was selling to a growing number of countries around the world.Image caption Marel's machines enable fish processing firms to box up neat fillets in just minutesThorgeir Palsson, from Reykjavik University's School of Business, says that Marel has successfully followed the "export or die" route of all large Icelandic firms."Iceland is obviously a very small country, so the home market quickly becomes mature or saturated," says Mr Palsson.He adds that like other Icelandic firms who enjoy strong overseas sales, Marel has always realised that it cannot compete on cost.Given the high labour costs in Iceland compared with, for example, China, Marel has instead focused on technological advancement - offering hi-tech solutions that while more expensive, do a better and more reliable job.Image caption The equipment is made in Iceland, then exported around the worldOne example of this is Marel's computerised "flexicut" machine, which uses x-rays, high pressure jets of water, and spinning blades to automatically portion out fish fillets.Able to process 50 fillets every minute, or one every 1.2 seconds, the x-rays determine how to cut up each fillet according to its thickness and length, before the water jets push out any remaining bones, and then the blades cut the fish.The company has similar technology for dealing with poultry and fish, but as Mr Thordarson admits, sometimes the company needs to read up on the culinary preferences of certain export markets.A good example is China, where he says that Marel initially made the mistake of trying "to bring a European solution to the Chinese market".So while Marel's machines were all about neatly removing the chicken breasts, as this is the meat most in demand in Europe, the Chinese focus is instead on the chicken legs, which were getting damaged.This is the sixth story in a new series called Connected Commerce, which every week highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market."So we were literally breaking a leg when we entered the Chinese market 15-20 years ago," says Mr Thordarson.Marel soon adapted its machines in China to solve the problem.Mr Thordarson adds that since its acquisitions strategy first started to gather pace in the early 1990s it has learned that the firms it buys should be integrated into Marel as soon as possible, to ensure their smooth running following the takeover.Having seen its revenues grow by more than 20% every year since 1992, Marel now employs 5,000 globally, and its overseas operations account for 99% of its earnings.Image caption To remove fish bones a Marel machine uses water at such a high pressure that it would cut through a human handThe firm's business model sees it make 60% of its income from sales, and 40% from after sales servicing and maintenance.With the global food processing machinery market for fish, meat and poultry, expected to expand to $7.9bn by 2021, up from $5.8bn last year, Marel intents to just keep on growing.Mr Thordarson says: "Today our markets are growing fast in South America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East."If you really want to change things, you have to become global and serve all markets."
Can property developers be taught to be ethical?
A degree course teaches New York property developers to think of more than money.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Can New York property developers be taught to think more about community?Property developers have been blamed for a lot, from the financial crash to gentrification.Whether deserved or not, there's a perception of them as being selfish and greedy.But a master's course at Columbia University in New York is trying to change this image by teaching the next generation of developers to be more community-minded.The degree is taught at Columbia's Center for Urban Real Estate."Property developers have a terrible reputation," says course director Dr Patrice Derrington, who was one of the developers responsible for rebuilding downtown New York after 9/11.When Talar Sarkassian tells people that she is studying at Columbia for an MSc in real estate development, a common response is: "Oh, you must be in it for the money".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rooms with a view: The course wants students to take a more ethical view of property"I often have to justify and explain what I'm doing to people and why, so they can understand it from my perspective rather than basing their judgement on the stereotypes," she says.This image became even more complicated when another controversial property developer entered the White House as president.Better valueEvery year more than a hundred students take the course at Columbia, which has produced some of New York's leading real-estate developers.Students are taught to focus on the needs of the community that will live alongside a planned new development, rather than pursue pure profit.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Developers are told to focus on more long-term outcomes for the cityDr Derrington says this is not just the ethical thing to do. It can be the best way for a developer to guarantee a project is profitable."A developer today is only one of many agents that are part of the process of putting up a building, and they are not the loudest voice," she says.That most influential voice, she argues, belongs to the local community around the site of a proposed new building.Through social media, people are better informed about proposed developments and more willing to defend their area from perceived threats."Across the world, developments have been rejected or seriously reduced because of objections from the local community," says Dr Derrington."Today, a successful developer needs to be patient and listen to the community."Students on the course are taught that although speculating on building luxury flats to sell to foreign investors can give high returns, these properties often go unsold - particularly if there is a downturn in the market.'More than the bottom line'Instead, building flats that people will live in, or offices that provide space for local businesses, can a better guarantee of commercial success.Student Talar Sarkassian says the course has taught her about the impact a development can have on the area around it. It's not just providing housing, but can be create jobs or facilities for the community."It is about more than just the bottom line," she says.Image caption Columbia University's Center for Urban Real Estate is teaching the next generation of developersRecent graduate Jamie Horton is already putting what he learned into practice as a project manager at New York-based Janus Property Company.The company is developing a new commercial campus that will create much-needed local jobs."The vision for the project is to create a job centre in New York's Harlem, which currently has very little office space," he says.Early warningsA master's degree is an unusual route into working in property development.Dr Derrington hopes taking an academic approach to real estate will help the industry to anticipate events like the sub-prime mortgage collapse of 2008."Real estate and finance were entirely to blame for the crash," she says.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The course wants more academic research on property bubbles and how they burst"It's a cycle, so we know that it will happen again. We are trying to prepare our students so that they can spot this early and help to alleviate it."She says the industry is already making similar mistakes, and predicts another crash could happen within two years."We are now at a point where it will take 17 years to fill the supply of luxury condominiums which are on sale for more than $5m (£3.8m)," she says."We have an over-supply and you are already starting to see investors pull back.""The signs are there and it is going to be very interesting over the next few years."More from Global educationIdeas for the Global education series?

Mugabe and me: A personal history of growing up in Zimbabwe

Then an announcer's voice, speaking emphatically, with dramatic pauses before every word. "This Is The Voice Of Zimbabwe." Then the song that all the township children came to know so well, the closest we would get to war:"Kune nzira dzamasoja dzekuzvibatanadzo. Tererai mitemo yose nenzira dzakanaka."I remember vividly the last two years of Rhodesia's war. As children repeating that song in the school playground, we did not know that it was an adaptation of Mao Zedong's Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention."Be honest in buying and selling, return everything you borrow, pay compensation for everything you damage, do not hit or swear at others, do not damage crops, do not harass women and do not mistreat prisoners."These principles, translated into the Shona language and set in song, were the code of conduct for the struggle for independent rule in Rhodesia.'His voice was rich and beautiful'I was eight when the war ended. It was far from our family in the township of Glen Norah in Salisbury, but the war came to us every night as my father Tererayi Mureri fiddled with our radio receiver to catch the shortwave transmission from Radio Mozambique.I was with my mother Simbiso when the news reached us that guerrilla leader Josiah Tongogara had died. Her grieving shock was so penetrating that in my confusion, I thought we had lost a relative.Image copyright AFP Image caption 'At school the independence war was cast as a heroic struggle'It was through this transmission that Robert Mugabe came into my life, and entered my imagination as the embodiment of the struggle.His voice was rich and beautiful. I would later come to understand that what made his voice so unusual was that it was essentially manufactured, carrying almost no trace of his education or ethnic background.I did not understand everything he said, but I remember that he called us always the people, not of Rhodesia, but Zimbabwe. This reminder, that this was a battle for a new country, and a new way to be in the world, was emphasised by the words that concluded each broadcast, "People of Zimbabwe, Victory Is Certain."Hero worshipVictory finally came after a ceasefire that ended the war and negotiations in London to chart the path for the new country.After the elections in March 1980, I sat with my parents and younger siblings as Mugabe addressed us again, this time on television as prime minister of our new country.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mugabe: From war hero to resignationThere was that voice again, but with an image to go with it, not of a fearsome gorilla, which is how I heard the word guerrilla, but of a man in large glasses who wore a safari suit like my father's.I found him reassuringly normal. Surely, he said, this is the time to beat our swords into ploughshares. We should become Zimbabweans with a single loyalty, to our nation, and to a common interest.That year, we moved house. In my simplified understanding of the world then, I thought it was purely thanks to Mugabe that my parents were able to buy a new house in a former whites-only suburb that had a library with more books than I could have dreamt of. In my mind, I associated Mugabe with these riches.I learned more about Mugabe the guerrilla in history lessons at secondary school.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption "Seeing him on television for the first time I noticed he wore a safari suit like my father's"Our O-Level class of 1988 was the first to study under the new curriculum. So we learned that the history of all society is the history of class struggle. The independence war was re-cast as a heroic, historically inevitable struggle between the black socialist majority and white minority capitalism.I poured over the black and white pictures of Mugabe and other independence leaders. I fell in love with African history.By the time I went to the University of Zimbabwe to study law, I was a budding Marxist-Leninist. My feelings for Mugabe were approaching hero worship.Then came a shift.Political awakeningIn my first year, I attended the ceremony for that year's graduating class with a friend, Chris Giwa who was head of the student council.As we walked to the university's Great Hall, another student, Eric Mvududu, approached President Mugabe with a petition. Mugabe's security men stopped him and roughed him up, tearing his shirt and bruising him. Mugabe walked on.In the Great Hall, he tapped the heads of students as they knelt before him. Then came Arthur Mutambara, the leader of the previous year's council, who had led demonstrations against government corruption. As he approached the president, a great cheer went up. Mugabe rose from his seat and pumped Mutambara's hand. The Great Hall roared.Afterwards, in Chris's room in New Hall, I sat with Mutambara (who years later became an opposition politician), the now recovered Mvududu and other friends and listened to them talk. It was the start of my political awakening.By the end of the academic year, I had studied constitutional law, and learned, through case law on illegal detentions, that all the time I had been gulping down books as a child in the library, a state of emergency had been in place in Matabeleland, and that region had been the theatre of mass killings by the army's Fifth Brigade.Image caption The army was accused of atrocities in MatabelelandBy the time I came face to face with Mugabe at my own graduation four years later, I was no longer a believer.Gone was the hero worship, but still left was deep and conflicted respect. As the Dean read out my achievements and I knelt before him to be capped, I looked into the face of my president. In that voice, the voice I had first heard in our township house when Zimbabwe was just a dream, Mugabe said to me, "Congratulations, well done."Image copyright Petina Gappah Image caption After her studies in Zimbabwe the author (second from right) went on to postgraduate study in Britain at the University of CambridgeThe last 17 years saw me count myself among his opponents as he waged another war, this time against the country he had promised.We could not count all the bodies after that terrible war of liberation, but those that we could, we gave funeral rites and buried in places of honour. But how do you count the bodies of those who died in the war Mugabe waged against his own people?Dark shadowPeople like Mrs Nleya, a teacher I loved, who was trained in England and returned to Zimbabwe at the promise of independence, but died when the one oncologist in her city closed his practice, and moved to Botswana.Or the many who died of conditions easily cured but for the shortage of drugs.Or the border jumpers, almost all of whom were born after 1980, the Born Frees who drowned in the Limpopo on their way to South Africa, and hope.The companies small and large, built up over years of hard work that collapsed under the weight of inflation. The livelihoods flushed away, the lost opportunities, the cheated dreams.Image copyright AFP Image caption Zimbabwe's economy collapsed under Mr MugabeWas it all so that one man could rule until his death, so that he could, as opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said so poignantly, destroy not only what he had inherited, but also what he had built himself?Thirty-seven years after he promised that we would all build a Great Zimbabwe - but did everything he could to destroy it - Mugabe has left the stage.No single person has influenced the direction of my life as much as he has.To his government, I owe an education equal to that of anyone I have met, from anywhere in the world.Both as a writer and critic, and as a lawyer, my work has been an attempt to shine some light in the dark shadow that he cast over my country.And while I will always honour his place in history, there is not much I would not have given to be able to say back to him his only words to me, "Congratulations, well done," but this time, about his own legacy.
Egypt attack: Fake Sinai photos on social media
In the aftermath of the bomb attack on a Sinai mosque, fake photos have been shared on social media.
Image copyright @alaraby_ar Image caption This photo is actually three years old and not from Friday's attackHow do you know if the photographs and video footage that you see on social media after an attack are real?In the absence of concrete facts, many people - and news organisations - turn to social media for information.The deadly attack on the al-Rawda mosque in Egypt's North Sinai province, which killed at least 235 people, was no different.In its immediate aftermath, news site Al-Araby shared a dramatic image of crowds outside a smoking building.The headline read: "Sinai: 200 people killed and wounded in the bombing of a mosque".The ambulance shown is indeed Egyptian. However, this image does not show the 24 November attack in Sinai.How do we know?By conducting a reverse image search, we can see that the photo was actually taken by a photographer working for the news agency AFP in 2015.It shows the aftermath of a bomb attack in another Egyptian town which killed eight people.To conduct a reverse image search, right click on an image and select "search for image". You'll then see the other places on the internet where it appears.Degraded videoOther social media users shared a video supposedly taken "during the bombing of al-Rawda Mosque" in Sinai.Image copyright @mohadbolandBut this video was in fact first uploaded by Twitter user Mohammad Boland in early 2015, during an attack on a Shiite mosque in eastern Saudi Arabia.The original version of the distressing video, which was shown on American news network CNN, is much higher quality.Video quality can be degraded when it is downloaded and re-uploaded - which makes it harder to find the original when you carry out a reverse image search.The wrong mosqueAnother way of spotting a fake photo is to check the surroundings.Several users had shared a photo that showed a minaret collapsing during an explosion. But the minaret was not from the mosque in Sinai.It was taken in Mosul in 2014.If you come across that photo, compare it to the minaret from the mosque in Sinai, below. They clearly do not match.Image copyright AFP Image caption This is the mosque near al-Arish targeted by the militants in Sinai.There are plenty of genuine images of the devastating attack in Sinai and its aftermath. But there are fake photos in circulation - and by right clicking and carrying out your own reverse image search, you can check from where they really originate.Read more from Reality CheckFollow us on Twitter

How INXS Kick-started their career
The rock group look back at the 30th anniversary of their breakthrough album, Kick.
Image caption Kick was the band's international breakthrough albumsFive albums into their career, INXS had clawed their way up from Australia's pub circuit to the US top five.But no one was prepared for the success of their sixth album, Kick, a sensuous blend of funk, rock and pop that sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.Heralded by the slinky single Need You Tonight, Kick finally broke the band in the UK, and made a star of singer Michael Hutchence.Incredibly, though, their record label initially refused to release the album.According to the band's manager, Chris Murphy, he had a nailbiting encounter with Atlantic Records president Doug Morris when he first took the album to New York."He put his feet up on the desk and closed his eyes from the minute the record went on to the minute it finished," Murphy recalls in the sleeve notes for a new, deluxe edition of the record."When it stopped, he said, 'I'll give you a million dollars to go and record another album'."Image copyright INXS Image caption INXS in 1987 (L-R): Tim Farriss, Michael Hutchence, Kirk Pengilly, Garry Gary Beers, Andrew Farriss, Jon FarrissLuckily, wiser heads prevailed, and Kick produced an enviable four top 40 hits in the UK - Need You Tonight, New Sensation, Never Tear Us Apart and Mystify (a fifth, Devil Inside, narrowly missed the chart).As the album turns 30, INXS keyboard player and chief songwriter Andrew Farriss looks back at the making of the album.Nile Rodgers helped them find the funkINXS started in 1977 as a plucky pub band, with Michael Hutchence joining his schoolfriend Andrew Farriss on stage with his brothers, Tim and Jon. Their early singles fused the swagger of the Stones with the frenetic energy of punk - but they weren't much to write home about.But by 1983, the band had become obsessed with Chic star Nile Rodgers' solo album, Adventures in the Land of the Good Groove, and persuaded him to work on a song they'd knocked up called Original Sin."We recorded that in New York," Farriss recalls. "Nile played guitar, Darryl Hall sang backing vocals and a couple of guys from David Bowie's band put instrumental bits on it as well. No pressure!"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Nile Rodgers also worked with Madonna, Duran Duran and David Bowie in the 80sOriginal Sin gave INXS their first number one in Australia, prompting them to pursue a fusion of pop and funk on their next album, Listen Like Thieves.The lead single from that album, What You Need, gave the band their first taste of chart success in the US, essentially acting as a dry run for what came next."What You Need led to us being very confident on Kick and to say, 'Let's put this on a plaque, nail it to the wall and call it our own thing'," says Farriss."Which is really what we did."Farriss and Hutchence took control of the sessionsPrevious INXS albums had featured contributions from all six members of the band. But after the success of What You Need, Farriss informed the others that he and Michael would write all of Kick by themselves."It wasn't an aggressive thing," he says. "We were on a tour bus somewhere in Europe and I said, 'Why don't you give Michael and I a crack at doing all the tracks?'"The idea was that we had tended to write the singles - so why don't we do all the songs and we might get more singles?"And they said, 'Yes, sure, it sounds like a good idea to us'."I'll never forget that because, for Michael and I, feeling like we had that support was a very generous thing."Mystify could have sounded very differentImage copyright Rex Features Image caption Hutchence embraced the rock and roll lifestyle and sadly died by suicide in 1997The deluxe version of Kick contains an early version Mystify that features heavy drum loops and a very different melody - and none of the finished version's sex appeal.Farriss says this early draft, which he recorded with Hutchence on a tour stop in Chicago, was evidence of a new way of working."On that tour we realised that, even though we had these songs we'd been working on, we needed to experiment with them before we got into the studio."[But] we actually couldn't afford to have a huge studio full of lavish gear, with people just lying around waiting for us to walk through the golden doors."So we went into demo studios, which we never normally did before that. And we were demoing things on the run: 'We've got some time in-between gigs, let's go in and fiddle around with this thing in whatever country we're in'."Songs were finished in the basement of Sydney Opera HouseINXS were insistent that these new songs could be played live before they were recorded so, after reconvening in Australia in late 1986, they hired out the orchestra room beneath the Sydney Opera House."I won't lie, it was really, really cool," laughs Farriss. "It's this huge, iconic thing in the middle of Sydney Harbour and we just looked at it and went, 'Yeah, let's go in there!'"But we'd begun to get a lot more recognised at that point and there's very heavy security around that building, for obvious reasons. So it was just an awesome place to rehearse."Farriss wrote Need You Tonight in a panicThe first set of recording sessions started on 9 March 1987 at Sydney's Rhinoceros Studios; resulting in the songs Mystify, New Sensation, Never Tear Us Apart and Devil Inside, amongst others.But the band soon realised they hadn't enough tracks to achieve their ambition of an album where every song was a potential single. So producer Chris Thomas sent Farriss and Hutchence off to Hong Kong to write some more material."I think that was a very smart idea because it then gave us the chance to reflect on those initial recordings and work out what songs we might be missing," says Farriss.Image caption Need You Tonight was the band's only number one single in the USBut the band's biggest hit arrived in a flash of inspiration, just as the taxi arrived to take him to the airport"I'm about to leave home when, suddenly, I started playing that riff from Need You Tonight," he recalls. "And I thought, 'Wow - this is ridiculous, I've got to record this!'"So I asked the cab driver to wait - and he kept honking his horn and flashing his lights and shouting, 'we're going to miss the plane!'."But I made it at the last minute - and I had a cassette of the recording. When I got out at the other end [of the flight], I took it straight to the demo studio where Michael was waiting for me and he said, 'that's awesome... let me do a vocal'."And the most insane thing was, he put that vocal straight down. It was crazy."Never Tear Us Apart became a standardOriginally written as a piano-based rockabilly song, Never Tear Us Apart transformed into a grand, dramatic ballad, featuring one of Hutchence's most impassioned vocals.Unlike a lot of INXS songs, which fall apart when played by another band, the song has become a rock standard and reality show staple."There's so many different versions I can't even remember them all," says Farriss. "But there's a couple that stand out to me. Tom Jones and Natalie Imbruglia covered it as a duet, which was incredible."And Joe Cocker recorded it. I was always a huge fan of his and I couldn't believe it when he did that. I was just like, 'wow'."Kick sold by the bucketloadImage caption INXS's later hits included Suicide Blonde, Beautiful Girl and Elegantly WastedFor Atlantic Records, Kick was a hard sell. In the heavily-formatted world of US radio, it didn't work as a rock record, it wouldn't fit on funk stations, and pop radio was wary of harder tracks like Guns In The Sky."I think they thought Kick was from outer space," says Farriss. And the album was a slow burn - taking 18 months to really take off on a global scale.But it became the band's legacy, going platinum eight times in the US and being certified diamond in Canada (by 1990, one in 20 Canadians owned a copy of Kick).By 1991, INXS were able to sell out Wembley Stadium and, while they had several more top 10 albums, they deliberately avoided repeating Kick's formula."Either we were really, really stupid or we just were sonic explorers, but we never went and made Kick again," says Farriss. "We could have done. We knew exactly how to do it. But that's just the way INXS was".The 30th anniversary edition of Kick is out now.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Emmerson Mnangagwa: Will he be different from Mugabe?
How different might Emmerson Mnangagwa be from Robert Mugabe, as president of Zimbabwe?
Image copyright AFP"This is the beginning of a new unfolding democracy in our country," Emmerson Mnangagwa told his supporters at his first public address since returning to Zimbabwe. But is it?For five decades, Mr Mnangagwa was former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's protégé, comrade, and right-hand man.He was at his side during the fight against white minority rule, and during the post-liberation government.He is also said to have been behind some of the most notorious acts of repression which helped keep Mr Mugabe in power.There are, however, some key differences between the man likely to become Zimbabwe's new president, and his former mentor.Here are a few of them:Youth on his side - relativelyImage copyright AFP Image caption Young people were among the thousands waiting to welcome Mr MnangagwaMr Mnangagwa may be in his 70s but that is still around two decades younger than the man he is replacing.There is some dispute over whether he is 71 or 75. Mr Mnangagwa is said to have avoided being hanged when arrested during the fight for independence by lying about his age.But while Mr Mugabe was notoriously stubborn, Mr Mnangagwa is said to be more flexible in his approach, if only for the purposes of achieving his goals.With elections planned for next year, many in the ruling Zanu-PF party, whose ranks are filled with veterans of the struggle for independence, will be hoping he can reach out to Zimbabwe's youth.Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Mnangagwa (right) fell in and out of his former leader's gracesHowever, like Mr Mugabe, he has a reputation for ruthlessness. He was in charge of state security during the Matabeleland massacres of the 1980s, in which some 20,000 people were killed on suspicion of being part of a rebellion.And human rights groups accuse him of being behind a violent crackdown on opposition supporters after the disputed 2008 election.So one key question facing Zimbabwe, is whether he will allow the next election to be free and fair.PragmaticImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Emmerson Mnangagwa received a hero's welcome on his returnAs well as being more flexible, Mr Mnangagwa is arguably more pragmatic than Mr Mugabe.He is said to have recently held secret talks with opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, although the BBC has not been able to independently verify this.While it is still far from certain that he would be open to a widely mooted government of national unity, it certainly looks more likely than it did a week ago.For Mr Mnangagwa, a key concern - by most accounts - is showing the international community that his country is stable, in order to secure investment in the economy.Open for businessThe BBC's Stanley Kwenda in Harare says that Mr Mnangagwa has a good reputation in the business sector, and tried to protect productive farms operated by white farmers during the controversial land reform programme.Mr Mnangagwa served as acting finance minster between 1995-1996, during a period of relative economic stability.He said in an interview last year that "capital goes where it feels comfortable and warm, and if it's cold it runs to a country which gives it better weather".That seems to have been a reference to the dire state of Zimbabwe's economy, and what it might take to turn it around following years of sanctions imposed after the seizure of white-owned farms.And in his speech after his return from exile, he said his focus would be on "jobs, jobs, jobs".Five ways to revive Zimbabwe’s economyWho is Emmerson Mnangagwa?Image copyright ReutersCalled "the crocodile" because of his political shrewdness - his Zanu-PF faction was known as "Lacoste"Received military training in China and EgyptTortured by Rhodesian forces after his "crocodile gang" staged attacksHelped direct Zimbabwe's 1970s war of independenceBecame the country's spymaster during the 1980s civil conflict, in which thousands were killedDenies any role in the massacresSeen as key link between army, intelligence agencies and Zanu-PFAccused of masterminding attacks on opposition supporters after 2008 electionJournalist Martin Fletcher, who interviewed him last year, says Mr Mnangagwa was keen to indicate that Zimbabwe would change under his leadership.Mr Fletcher told the BBC that "he wanted to signal to the West that he would be different from Mugabe, that he understood the need to restore the Zimbabwean economy. He was saying 'we want to attract foreign investment, [and] he talked about the need for the diaspora to come back, about the need to re-engage the West'".That is likely to mean getting rid of polices like the indigenisation laws, which required all companies - including foreign investors - to be 51% owned by indigenous, ie black Zimbabweans.He is also likely to address the issue of land ownership, and access to land for white farmers.Army linksImage copyright AFP Image caption Zimbabwe Army General Constantino Chiwenga (left) is an ally of Mr MnangagwaMr Mugabe always enjoyed the support of the army, having been the political leader of the 1970s war of independence in which most of Zimbabwe's generals fought.But he was ultimately toppled by the military, who were even more loyal to Mr Mnangagwa.In particular, Mr Mnangagwa is close to army chief Gen Constantino Chiwenga.Chiwenga: The army chief who took power from MugabeOn his return to Harare following Mr Mugabe's resignation, Mr Mnangagwa said that he had been "in constant contact" with security chiefs during the military takeover.Mr Mnangagwa was a teenage fighter in the war of independence, which he went on to lead.Image copyright AFP Image caption Those who fought in Zimbabwe's 1970s war of independence have long monopolised powerAs national security minister during the 1980s, he cemented his ties in the military and intelligence services, which have remained a loyal base.It is perhaps this relationship that concerns the opposition the most.MDC-T MP Eddie Cross told the BBC that "in many respects he is one of the architects of the collapse in Zimbabwe"."He's certainly been involved in many of the not-so-good episodes in recent years, including the 2013 election, which he pretty much managed on his own."I think, for many of us, we will fear that there won't be sufficient change".Charisma deficitImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Mnangagwa's supporters within Zanu-PF are known as the Lacoste factionWhatever his faults, Mr Mugabe was undoubtedly a powerful orator, at ease whipping up a crowd, or, in the early days at least, discussing delicate diplomatic issues with world leaders.The same cannot be said of Mr Mnangagwa.His daughter says he is not an emotional man, while his son (a Harare DJ known as St Emmo) says: "He doesn't say much and I think that's what frightens people - like: 'What is he thinking?'"His nickname is "The Crocodile", hardly one of nature's most charismatic beasts.It was originally given to him during the liberation struggle when he led the so-called "crocodile gang".The name was later used to refer to his political shrewdness - his ability to lie low and then attack, viciously.
Flies more germ-laden than suspected
Flies' disease-carrying potential may be greater than previously thought, say US researchers.
Image copyright Ana Junqueira and Stephan Schuster Image caption Bristles on a fly's body attract bacteriaScientists have discovered that flies carry more diseases than suspected.The house fly and the blowfly together harbour more than 600 different bacteria, according to a DNA analysis.Many are linked with human infections, including stomach bugs, blood poisoning and pneumonia.Flies can spread bacteria from place-to-place on their legs, feet and wings, experiments show. In fact, every step taken by a fly can transfer live bacteria, researchers said.''People had some notion that there were pathogens that were carried by flies but had no idea of the extent to which this is true and the extent to which they are transferred," Prof Donald Bryant of Penn State University, a co-researcher on the study, told BBC News.OutbreaksDNA sequencing techniques were used to study the collection of microbes found in and on the bodies of the house fly (Musca domestica) and the blowfly (Chrysomya megacephala).The house fly, which is ubiquitous around the world, was found to harbour 351 types of bacteria. The blowfly, which is found in warmer climates, carried 316. A large number of these bacteria were carried by both types of fly.The researchers, who published their study in the journal Scientific Reports, say flies may have been overlooked by public health officials as a source of disease outbreaks."We believe that this may show a mechanism for pathogen transmission that has been overlooked by public health officials, and flies may contribute to the rapid transmission of pathogens in outbreak situations," said Prof Bryant."It will really make you think twice about eating that potato salad that's been sitting out at your next picnic," he added.Image copyright Ana Junqueira and Stephan Schuster Image caption Head of a blowfly under the electron microscopeHowever, the researchers believe flies could have their uses - acting as early warning systems for disease or even living drones sent into tight spaces to search for microbes."In fact, the flies could be intentionally released as autonomous bionic drones into even the smallest spaces and crevices and, upon being recaptured, inform about any biotic material they have encountered," said Stephan Schuster, research director at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.House flies are well known for their poor hygiene habits - visiting rubbish tips and feeding on all sorts of decaying food, animal corpses and faecal matter. They are suspected of carrying a range of human, animal and plant diseases.Blow flies are one of the most common flies found around dead animals. They are common in urban areas and are often found near meat-processing plants, rubbish dumps and slaughterhouses.Follow Helen on Twitter.
Galapagos finches caught in act of becoming new species
A population of finches on the Galapagos is discovered in the process of becoming a new species.
Image caption This is an image of the Big Bird lineage, which arose through the breeding of two distinct parent species: G. fortis and G. conirostrisA population of finches on the Galapagos has been discovered in the process of becoming a new species.This is the first example of speciation that scientists have been able to observe directly in the field.Researchers followed the entire population of finches on a tiny Galapagos island called Daphne Major, for many years, and so they were able to watch the speciation in progress.The research was published in the journal Science.The group of finch species to which the Big Bird population belongs are collectively known as Darwin's finches and helped Charles Darwin to uncover the process of evolution by natural selection.In 1981, the researchers noticed the arrival of a male of a non-native species, the large cactus finch.Professors Rosemary and Peter Grant noticed that this male proceeded to mate with a female of one of the local species, a medium ground finch, producing fertile young.Almost 40 years later, the progeny of that original mating are still being observed, and number around 30 individuals."It's an extreme case of something we're coming to realise more generally over the years. Evolution in general can happen very quickly," said Prof Roger Butlin, a speciation expert who wasn't involved in the study.What makes a species?This new finch population is sufficiently different in form and habits to the native birds, as to be marked out as a new species, and individuals from the different populations don't interbreed.Prof Butlin told the BBC that people working on speciation credit the Grant professors with altering our understanding of rapid evolutionary change in the field.In the past, it was thought that two different species must be unable to produce fertile offspring in order to be defined as such. But in more recent years, it has been established that many birds and other animals that we consider to be unique species are in fact able to interbreed with others to produce fertile young."We tend not to argue about what defines a species anymore, because that doesn't get you anywhere," said Prof Butlin. What he says is more interesting is understanding the role that hybridisation can have in the process of creating new species, which is why this observation of Galapagos finches is so important.The researchers think that the original male must have flown 65 miles from the large cactus finches' home island of Española. That's a very long way for a small finch to fly, and so it would be very unlikely for the bird to make a successful return flight.Image caption A member of the G. fortis species, one of two that interbred to give rise to the Big Bird lineageImage caption A finch belonging to the G. conirostris species. It's the other half of the pairing that gave rise to the Big Bird populationBy identifying one way that new species can arise, and following the entire population, the researchers state this as an example of speciation occurring in a timescale we can observe.In most cases, the offspring of cross-species matings are poorly adapted to their environment. But in this instance, the new finches on Daphne Major are larger than other species on the island, and have taken hold of new and unexploited food.For this reason, the researchers are calling the animals the "Big Bird population".To scientifically test whether the Big Bird population was genetically distinct from the three species of finch native to the island, Peter and Rosemary Grant collaborated with Prof Leif Andersson of Sweden's Uppsala University who analysed the population genetically for the new study.Prof Andersson told BBC News: "The surprise was that we would expect the hybrid would start to breed with one of the other species on the island and be absorbed… we have confirmed that they are a closed breeding group."Due to an inability to recognise the songs of the new males, native females won't pair with this new species.Image copyright FRANS LANTING, MINT IMAGES / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Image caption The finches led Darwin to his theory of natural selection, as outlined in On The Origin of SpeciesAnd in this paper, new genetic evidence shows that after two generations, there was complete reproductive isolation from the native birds. As a result, they are now reproductively - and genetically - isolated. So they have been breeding exclusively with each other over the years."What we are saying is that this group of birds behave as a distinct species. If you didn't know anything about [Daphne Major's] history and a taxonomist arrived on this island they would say there are four species on this island," said Prof Andersson.There is no evidence that they will breed again with the native medium ground finch, but even if they did, they now have a larger size and can exploit new opportunities. Those advantageous traits may be maintained by natural selection.So hybridisation can lead to speciation, simply through the addition of one individual to a population. It may therefore be a way for new traits to evolve quickly."If you just wait for mutations causing one change at a time, then it would make it more difficult to raise a new species that way. But hybridisation may be more effective than mutation," said Prof Butlin.Follow Rory on Twitter.
Deep fat fryers may help form cooling clouds
The fatty acids released in cooking may help form clouds that cool the climate, say scientists.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The University of Reading say molecules from burning fat could counteract global warming.Fatty acids released into the air from cooking may contribute to the formation of clouds that cool the climate, say scientists.Fatty acid molecules comprise about 10% of fine particulates over London, and such particles help seed clouds.But researchers dismiss the idea that cooking fats could be used as a geo-engineering tool to reduce warming.Instead, the research is designed to help reduce uncertainties about the role of cooking fats on climate.Researchers believe the fatty molecules arrange themselves into complex 3-D structures in atmospheric droplets.These aerosols persist for longer than normal and can seed the formation of clouds which experts say can have a cooling effect on the climate.The authors say the study will shed new light on the long term role of aerosols on temperatures.Atmospheric aerosols are one of the areas of climate science where there are considerable uncertainties.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Molecules from deep fat frying may have a cooling effect on the climateThe description covers tiny particles that can be either solid or liquid, ranging from the dusts of the Saharan desert to soot to aerosols formed by chemical reaction.These can have a variety of impacts, while most aerosols reflect sunlight back into space others absorb it.Aerosols and the clouds seeded by them, are said to reflect about a quarter of the Sun's energy back into space.Researchers have known for some time that the emissions of fatty acid molecules from chip pans and cookers may coat aerosol particles in the atmosphere - but this is the first time that scientists have looked at their role inside the droplets.Using ultrasonic levitation to hold individual droplets of brine and oleic acid in position, the research team was able to make them float so they could analyse them with a laser beam and X-rays.Image copyright Dr Christian Pfrang Image caption Fatty acid molecules were levitated so researchers could probe their interior structuresThe X-rays proved crucial in revealing the inner structure."We found these drops could form these self-assembled phases which means these molecules can stay much longer in the atmosphere," said lead author Dr Christian Pfrang, from the University of Reading."These self-assembled structures are highly viscous so instead of having a water droplet you have something that behaves much more like honey, so processes inside the droplet will slow down," he told BBC News."They are resistant to oxidation so they stay around longer, so cloud formation will be easier."Scientists believe that the number of fatty acid molecules in the air is relatively high, comprising about 10% of the fine particulate matter over London, according to research published last year.This could be having an impact on the number of clouds and the amount of heat they reflect back into space."If you want to establish emissions control measures for McDonalds for example, you could assume that instead of two hours the molecules can last more than one day," said Dr Pfrang."Then this air parcel that comes from McDonalds will travel 10 times further, this is important for local air pollution but also to determine the effect of clouds which is the largest uncertainty."Happening above our heads"We know that the complex structures we saw are formed by similar fatty acid molecules like soap in water," said co-lead author, Dr Adam Squires, from the University of Bath,"There, they dramatically affect whether the mixture is cloudy or transparent, solid or liquid, and how much it absorbs moisture from the atmosphere in a lab."The idea that this may also be happening in the air above our heads is exciting, and raises challenges in understanding what these cooking fats are really doing to the world around us."The researchers say that current large-scale atmospheric models do not account for the role of 3-D structures in aerosols at all, according to the research team.But they are dismissive of the idea that cooking fats could somehow be used as a form of geo-engineering to limit the impacts of global warming.Much more important they say, is to collect molecules from the atmosphere and bring them back for further study."If it does have an impact, it is likely to be a cooling one," said Dr Pfrang."And the extent urgently needs further research."The study has been published in the journal Nature Communications.
Dolly the sheep health fears 'unfounded'
Concerns that Dolly the cloned sheep had early-onset arthritis were unfounded, scientists say.
Image copyright SPL Image caption Dolly the Sheep on display in Edinburgh's Royal MuseumConcerns that Dolly the cloned sheep suffered from early-onset arthritis were unfounded, a study suggests.In fact, wear-and-tear in her joints was similar to that of other sheep of her age, regardless of how they were conceived, say researchers.Dolly, the first mammal cloned from an adult cell, made countless headlines during her lifetime.She came under close scrutiny, due to fears that cloned animals might develop health problems or age prematurely.Researchers at the University of Nottingham, have re-examined her skeleton."We felt we needed to set the record straight - how bad was Dolly?'' said Prof Kevin Sinclair."It was very similar to what we saw in our own animals and other naturally conceived sheep.''Hall of fameIt took 277 attempts to clone Dolly, and for a while she was arguably the world's most famous sheep.She made countless headlines over the years, from her birth in July 1996 to her death in February 2003.Image copyright SPL Image caption Megan and MoragHer health was monitored closely, including osteoarthritis of her left knee at the age of five years.However, a study last year of cloned ewes Debbie, Denise, Dianna and Daisy, who were derived from the cell line that gave rise to Dolly - found evidence of only mild or, in one case, moderate osteoarthritis.The ewes were older than Dolly, at eight years, prompting researchers to re-examine Dolly's case.Since none of Dolly's X-rays survived, the researchers X-rayed her skeleton.They also X-rayed the skeletons of her naturally conceived daughter, Bonnie, and Megan and Morag (the first two animals to be cloned from differentiated cells).These findings were compared with X-rays of healthy, naturally-conceived sheep.It turns out that the findings in Dolly were not unexpected, given her age.Sheep rarely live beyond the age of nine or ten, when kept as pets or in the wild."We found that the prevalence and distribution of radiographic-osteoarthritis was similar to that observed in naturally conceived sheep, and our healthy aged cloned sheep," said Prof Sandra Corr."As a result we conclude that the original concerns that cloning had caused early-onset osteoarthritis in Dolly were unfounded."Follow Helen on Twitter.
Plague reached Europe by Stone Age
Plague was present in Europe during the late Stone Age, according to a study of ancient remains.
Image copyright Stadtarchäologie Ausgburg Image caption Plague may already have been capable of causing epidemics in the Stone AgePlague was present in Europe during the late Stone Age, according to a study of ancient remains.Writing in Current Biology journal, researchers suggest the deadly bacterium entered Europe with a mass migration of people from further east.They screened more than 500 ancient skeletal samples and recovered the full genomes of plague bacteria from six individuals.These six variously date to between Late Neolithic and Bronze Age times.The plague-positive samples come from Russia, Germany, Lithuania, Estonia and Croatia."The two samples from Russia and Croatia are among the oldest plague-positive samples published. They are contemporary with [a] previously published sample from the Altai region [in Siberia]," co-author Alexander Herbig from the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, told BBC News.Cause of London Great Plague confirmedPlague traced back to Bronze AgeThe plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, was responsible for several major historic pandemics, including the infamous Black Death in the 14th Century, which is estimated to have killed between 30% and 60% of Europe's population.Analysis of the ancient plague DNA shows that Y. pestis genomes from the Neolithic and Bronze Age were all fairly closely related.This is intriguing because the individuals from which they were recovered come from such a wide geographic area."This suggests that the plague either entered Europe multiple times during this period from the same reservoir, or entered once in the Stone Age and remained there," said co-author Aida Andrades Valtueña, also from the Max Planck Institute in Jena.In order to clarify which scenario was most likely, the researchers looked for clues from archaeology and from the analysis of ancient human DNA.Image copyright SPL Image caption Yersinia pestis is the bacterial agent of plagueFrom about 4,800 years ago, there was a major expansion of people into Europe from a region called the Caspian-Pontic Steppe in present-day Russia and Ukraine.These people carried a distinctive genetic component - also seen in Siberians and Native Americans - that had not been present in Europeans before the late Neolithic.The earliest indications of plague in Europe coincide with the arrival of this "steppe ancestry" in Europeans.Dr Herbig said this supports "the view that Y. pestis was possibly introduced to Europe from the steppe around 4,800 years ago, where it established a local reservoir before moving back towards Central Eurasia".Analysis shows that plague bacteria genes related to virulence were changing at this time. But further work is needed to determine how these changes affected the severity of the disease.However, it's certainly possible that these early Y. pestis bacteria were already capable of causing large-scale epidemics.The steppe people could have been moving to get away from a plague outbreak - although the effects of climate change on the landscape in this region may also have played a role.The disease could also have been involved in profound genetic changes seen in European populations at this time. In some regions, the steppe people appear to have largely replaced the previous Neolithic inhabitants."It's possible that certain European populations, or the steppe people, may have had a different level of immunity [to Y. pestis]," said Johannes Krause, from the Max Planck Institute.Dr Herbig commented: "The plague might have been a factor among others that promoted the migration processes during this time period. However, our current data has insufficient resolution to see how specific regions within Europe were affected differently by the disease."He added that the team planned to screen more skeletal material from all over Europe as a next step.Follow Paul on Twitter.
Avatar therapy 'reduces power of schizophrenia voices'
Patients became less distressed and heard voices less often compared with those who had counselling.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How avatar therapy is helping people stand up to schizophrenic voices by giving them a faceConfronting an avatar on a computer screen helped patients hearing voices to cope better with hallucinations, a UK trial has found.Patients who received this therapy became less distressed and heard voices less often compared with those who had counselling instead.Experts said the therapy could add an important new approach to treating schizophrenia hallucinations.The trial, on 150 people, is published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal.It follows a much smaller pilot study in 2013.Hallucinations are common in people with schizophrenia and can be threatening and insulting.One in four patients continues to experience voices despite being treated with drugs and cognitive behavioural therapy.In this study, run by King's College London and University College London, 75 patients who had continued to hear voices for more than a year, were given six sessions of avatar therapy while another 75 received the same amount of counselling.In the avatar sessions, patients created a computer simulation to represent the voice they heard and wanted to control, including how it sounded and how it might look.Image copyright King's College London Image caption Three avatars created by people taking part in the therapyThe therapist then voiced the avatar while also speaking as themselves in a three-way conversation to help the patient gain the upper hand.Prof Tom Craig, study author from King's College London, said getting patients to learn to stand up to the avatar was found to be safe, easy to deliver and twice as effective as counselling at reducing how often voices were heard."After 12 weeks there was dramatic improvement compared to the other therapy," he said."With a talking head, patients are learning to confront and get replies from it."This shifts the idea that the voice is all-controlling," he said.Patients are encouraged to talk to the avatar and take control of the conversation, saying things such as, "I'm not going to listen to you any more."Seven patients who had had the avatar therapy and two from the counselling group said their hallucinations had completely disappeared after 12 weeks.Image copyright King's College London Image caption Prof Tom Craig acted as therapist and voiced the avatar in the therapy sessionsBy 24 weeks, however, the patients in both groups had shown the same levels of improvement, suggesting the avatar therapy required booster sessions in the long term, the study said.Prof Craig said the next step was to find out if the therapy worked in other locations before it could be made widely available on the NHS, but he said the findings were a "significant advance" in treating hallucinations.Prof Stephen Lawrie, head of psychiatry at the University of Edinburgh, said the trial was impressive and robust but more work was needed."Further study is required to replicate these results, establish the role of such treatment versus others such as CBT [cognitive behavioural therapy], and clarify who might benefit most."'Promising'Sir Robin Murray, professor of psychiatric research at King's College London's Institute of Psychiatry, said that if they could be reproduced, the findings "will add an important new approach to care".He added: "If a wholly psychological intervention such as avatar therapy can produce such an improvement, then it should make us rethink the way we conceptualise auditory hallucinations."Brian Dow, from charity Rethink Mental Illness, said he welcomed any attempts to try and develop new and innovative treatments for schizophrenia."Hallucinations can be extremely traumatising for patients who experience them and the results of the this trial are promising."
EU ban on bird imports sees 'massive' cuts in global trade
There's been a 90% drop in the trade in wild birds around the globe mainly due to an EU ban, say researchers.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ring necked parakeets have become well established in the UK and elsewhere in EuropeA new study says that an EU ban on the trade in wild birds has helped reduce the global business by 90%.Prior to the 2005 regulation that limited the market, European countries were the foremost importers of birds, mainly from West Africa.These imported creatures often escaped and posed threats to local populations and ecosystems.Latin America has now become the main bird source, and is now responsible for 50% of the much smaller global market.Flu sparks banIt was in response to concerns about the spread of avian influenza that the EU imposed a temporary ban on wild bird imports in October 2005. This was made permanent two years later.Prior to the ban, the global trade saw around 1.3 million birds bought and sold every year, according to the Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).The EU was the world's biggest importer of birds at the time with Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain accounting for two thirds of all wild birds sold on the global market.About 70% of them came from West Africa, mainly from Guinea, Mali and Senegal."There is some redirection of trade to other areas and some may have gone underground, but the global drop is so massive that those cannot account for it on their own," author Dr Diederik Strubbe, from the University of Copenhagen, told BBC News."By implementing this ban the trade has effectively eliminated a lot of demand from the market and the main picture that emerges is that the trade has largely collapsed."Image copyright Jose-Luis Postigo Image caption There has been a big increase in the population of Egyptian geese in the UKLatin America has replaced Africa as the main source according to this study, supplying demand in Mexico and the United States. However the overall number of birds being traded has reduced to around 130,000 every year.What's also changed is the type of birds being bought and sold.Songbirds from Africa once dominated the market - now parrots are in the ascendant."The songbirds like canaries are only a fraction of what they were before, only 20% of the former level," said Dr Strubbe."The other popular birds are parakeets they have also declined a bit, not to the extent of the songbirds. Despite the ban they have remained rather popular on the global market and they have found new destinations."Other researchers in the field welcomed the new study."What was really elegant about this paper was that they brought a number of datasets together and they showed us that to some extent the supply chains reconfigure but to some extent they don't. So that this policy had a beneficial impact," said Dr Paul Jepson from the University of Oxford, who wasn't involved in the research."For me, it's one of the big issues in wildlife trade governance, understanding the dynamics of supply chains."The wild bird trade has long caused problems both in the country of origin and the importing nation.Europe has seen large numbers of invasive parrots causing damage to local ecosystems, out competing local birds and damaging crops. More than 100 cities across the continent have seen parakeets establish.So serious is the issue that a research group called Parrotnet was funded to assess the scale of the problem. In the UK, ring-necked parrots, descended from pets and aviary birds which have escaped or were deliberately released, have become so plentiful that they pose a threat to vineyards and fruit farms.Image copyright Marine Le Louarn Image caption Monk parakeets became established in the UK thanks to trade from South AmericaThere are also impacts on the countries where the birds are captured with a loss of biodiversity and a loss of income for those involved in the trade.The authors say that over time, the EU ban will likely end the ongoing problem of invasive birds."Among invasive species, birds are quite prevalent but our results suggest that the emergence of these, such as the parakeets living in Europe, are largely a phenomenon of the past," said Dr Strubbe."We do expect that invasions of new bird species will be become much rarer than before."The research has been published in the journal Science Advances.
High-energy 'ghost particles' absorbed by Earth
Neutrinos are famous for travelling through solid objects, but they don't go through everything, a study shows.
Image copyright Jamie Yang / IceCube Image caption Artwork: IceCube consists of an array of sensors embedded in very clear ice near the South PoleNeutrinos are known as "ghost particles", because they are known to travel through solid objects with ease.But a new study demonstrates that some of these sub-atomic particles are stopped in their tracks when they encounter our planet.Neutrinos interact so weakly with matter that a single one can pass through a light-year (10 trillion km) of lead without hitting an atom.The results come from the IceCube experiment, located in Antarctica.It's an important measurement that's consistent with the Standard Model - the theory that describes the behaviour of fundamental forces and particles, such as neutrinos.The neutrinos seen by the IceCube detector had very high energies. This was a critical factor since the higher the energy, the more likely the neutrinos are to interact with matter and therefore be absorbed by the Earth.Image copyright Jeffrey Donenfeld, NSF Image caption The IceCube laboratory is located at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station in AntarcticaIceCube consists of an array of 5,160 basketball-sized optical sensors called Digital Optical Modules (DOMs) that are encased within a cubic kilometre of very clear Antarctic ice near the South Pole.The experiment's sensors do not directly observe neutrinos, but instead measure flashes of blue light known as Cherenkov radiation. These flashes are emitted by other particles such as muons, which are produced when neutrinos interact with the ice.By measuring the light patterns from these interactions in or near the detector array, IceCube can estimate the neutrinos' directions and energies.The team found there were fewer energetic neutrinos making it all the way through Earth to the IceCube detector than those that reached it from less obstructed paths - such as near-horizontal trajectories."Understanding how neutrinos interact is key to the operation of IceCube," said Francis Halzen, chief scientist for IceCube and a professor of physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.Image copyright Mark Krasberg, IceCube/NSF Image caption A digital optical module (DOM) is lowered into the ice during construction of IceCubeThe results will allow team members to calculate something called the neutrino "cross-section" with a high degree of accuracy. The cross-section describes the probability that neutrinos of a given energy will interact with matter."We were of course hoping for some new physics to appear, but we unfortunately find that the Standard Model, as usual, withstands the test," said Prof Halzen.The finding, published in Nature journal, provides the first cross-section measurements for a neutrino energy range that is up to 1,000 times higher than previous measurements at particle accelerators.Most of the neutrinos selected for this study were more than a million times more energetic than those produced by more familiar sources, such as the Sun or nuclear power plants.The analysis could also be of interest to geophysicists who would like to use neutrinos to image the Earth's interior, though this will require more data than was used in the current study.Most of the neutrinos used in the study were generated in the Earth's atmosphere, through a process initiated by cosmic rays. But the results also include a small number of "astrophysical neutrinos", which are produced by unknown sources beyond the Earth's atmosphere.Another neutrino experiment, known as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune), is currently in development, and is due to switch on in the 2020s.Follow Paul on Twitter.
Light pollution: Night being lost in many countries
Much of the world is "losing the night" as artificial light becomes brighter and more widespread, say scientists.

Some of the world's "brightest nations", such as the US and Spain, remained the same. Most nations in South America, Africa and Asia grew brighter.Interactive India grew brighter between 2012 to 2016 2016 2012Only a few countries showed a decrease in brightness, such as Yemen and Syria - both experiencing warfare.The nocturnal satellite images - of glowing coastlines and spider-like city networks - look quite beautiful but artificial lighting has unintended consequences for human health and the environment.Let the Sun go downLead researcher Christopher Kyba from the German Research Centre for Geoscience in Potsdam said that the introduction of artificial light was "one of the most dramatic physical changes human beings have made to our environment".Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The brightest parts of the UK are getting brighterHe and his colleagues had expected to see a decrease in brightness in wealthy cities and industrial areas as they switched from the orange glow of sodium lights to more energy-efficient LEDs; the light sensor on the satellite is not able to measure the bluer part of the spectrum of light that LEDs emit."I expected that in wealthy countries - like the US, UK, and Germany - we'd see overall decreases in light, especially in brightly lit areas," he told BBC News. "Instead we see countries like the US staying the same and the UK and Germany becoming increasingly bright."Since the satellite sensor does not "see" the bluer light that humans can see, the increases in brightness that we experience will be even greater than what the researchers were able to measure.Prof Kevin Gaston from the University of Exeter told BBC News that humans were "imposing abnormal light regimes on ourselves".'Less light, better vision'"You now struggle to find anywhere in Europe with a natural night sky - without that skyglow we're all familiar with."Prof Gaston added that he found the continuing increase in light pollution curious. "Usually," he explained, "when we think of how humanity messes with environment, it's a costly thing to fix or reverse.Image copyright NASA Image caption The Nile and surrounding region are outlined by light at night"For light, it's just a case of directing it where we need it and not wasting it where we don't."Dr Kyba said that we could make our urban areas much dimmer and not actually cause any problems for visibility."Human vision relies on contrast, not the amount of light," he explained."So by reducing contrast outdoors - avoiding glaring lamps - it is actually possible to have improved vision with less light."That could mean big energy savings - but our data show that on a national and global scale, this is not the direction we are heading."Follow Victoria on Twitter
Research money central to Budget
The Chancellor Philip Hammond has made investment in research the centrepiece of his budget.
Image copyright PA Image caption Mr Hammond was given a tour of the Crick Institute in London in OctoberThe Chancellor Philip Hammond has made investment in research the centrepiece of his budget.Mr Hammond said extra money for research announced last year would continue and be gradually increased.He also said that the government's target is to increase public and private research investment from 1.68% of GDP to 2.4% of GDP by 2027.The Chancellor added that the government was investing in artificial intelligence and driverless cars.The president of the UK's Royal Society Venki Ramakrishnan welcomed the Chancellor's approach to investment in research."This budget sends a clear signal that the Government is focused on the UK's technological future, and the crucial pipeline of skills needed to ensure that we remain at the forefront of the technological revolution," he said."Technologies such as machine learning and AI have the potential to improve our lives in many ways, including creating jobs, and the government has also recognised that to truly take advantage of this potential there is much work to be done to ensure the benefits are shared by all."In last year's Autumn Statement, Mr Hammond announced a substantial increase in research funding over the next four years. It would receive an extra £425m in 2017/18, £820m in 2018/19, 1.5bn in 2019/20 and 2bn in 2020/21. This would be on top of the 6.5bn government science budget.Lesser increase?The Chancellor announced today that the additional funding for 2021/2022 would be £2.3bn.Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, chair of the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, said that the increase in funding was not as large as it might appear."R&D spend will actually only rise by £0.5bn against current commitments for 2020-21. The increase announced today will mean that a further £1.9bn will need to be added to the annual science budget between 2022 and 2027."At a time of uncertainty when the science community is looking to the government for leadership, the Chancellor's plans are a tentative move in the right direction, but much more is needed."The expectation is that the extra money being poured into research will encourage industry to increase its funding on R&D. The government has set itself the ambitious aim of doubling the total amount of money spent by public and private organisations on research from just over £30bn a year to £46bn by 2027.The UK currently spends 1.7% of its GDP on R&D, ranking 23rd behind Iceland and Norway. The Chancellor's latest uplift for science spending would put the government on track to play its part in raising the UK's percentage spend of GDP to 2.4%. This would raise Britain's ranking to 13th if other countries maintained their level of spending. But the UK would still be below Belgium.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Hammond said the government wants to increase investment from both public and private sourcesThe increase was hailed as part of a new industrial strategy which would aim to harness the UK's scientific strengths to boost the economy by creating new high tech companies and jobs.The additional money was given after a reorganisation of the current system of research funding. A new body, called the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) agency is to be created next year to oversee the allocation of funds.Dr Sarah Main, the director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering (Case) welcomed the additional funding but expressed concern that it might be skewed toward commercially beneficial areas of research, so called challenge funds involving industry, at the expense of fundamental and socially useful R&D."Such sizeable public investment brings a responsibility to spend it effectively. The new money is to be spent on modes of challenge-led funding that are relatively untested," she said."It will be important to establish mechanisms to ensure these funds are well spent and to grow the UK's tried and tested research funding mechanisms to meet research priorities as well as political priorities. After all, the UK needs a thriving research base to generate the stream of ideas that turn innovation into the products and services of tomorrow."Another concern is whether industry will deliver its end of the bargain. The private sector is expected to provide two thirds of the overall funding to reach the new GDP target.Mr Hammond announced that he would continue to review reforms that would allow more long-term funding from the financial sector rather than the two to five year return usually demanded by investors.To reach their target of R&D investment across the economy of 2.4% of GDP, "the government must attract private investment of over £8bn", said Dr Main."To continue to invest here, research-intensive companies are clear that the UK must provide a competitive economy with a healthy research base and immigration and regulation systems that support international R&D."The Chancellor also announced £9m for a new body to "enable ethical innovation in AI and data".Follow Pallab on Twitter
How dinosaur scales became bird feathers
The genes that caused scales to become feathers in the early ancestors of birds have been found by US scientists.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Birds and alligators are closely related, both belonging to the Archosaur groupThe genes that caused scales to become feathers in the early ancestors of birds have been found by US scientists.By expressing these genes in embryo alligator skin, the researchers caused the reptiles' scales to change in a way that may be similar to how the earliest feathers evolved.Feathers are highly complex natural structures and they're key to the success of birds.But they initially evolved in dinosaurs, birds' extinct ancestors.Leading the study, Professor Cheng-Ming Chuong told the BBC that this discovery links important recent palaeontological finds with modern biology, in understanding feather evolution.Birds have had feathers for as long as they have existed as a group and Professor Chuong couldn't study primitive examples of feathers in any living animals.Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Feathers evolved in dinosaurs: birds were a group of dinosaurs that evolved flight and survived the Cretaceous mass extinction"In today's existing reptiles, the one more similar to dinosaurs is actually the alligator, belonging to the Archosaur group," said Prof Chuong from the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles.Dinosaurs and birds also belong to this wider group of "Archosaur reptiles"; Prof Chuong wanted to investigate whether the feather-forming genes he had identified in birds could change those scales into feathers. So he set out to turn on these genes in the skin of alligator embryos."You can see we can indeed induce them to form appendages, although it is not beautiful feathers, they really try to elongate" he explained of the outcome. They are likely similar to the structures on those feather-pioneering dinosaurs 150 million years ago.The reason the gene doesn't cause the development of a fully feathered alligator is that unlike birds, alligators don't have the underlying genetic architecture evolved to support these central feather-making genes, or hold the structures in place on the skin.Image copyright MBE Image caption Normal embryonic scales (L) compared with the elongated scales after genetic modification (R)But the team's research does provide evidence for how early dinosaurs initiated the development of feathers.In recent years, palaeontologists have found evidence of "proto feathers" in a huge range of different dinosaur species."Feathered dinosaurs have unusual so called proto-feathers… it looks like they have feathers but the feathers are not identical to today's (bird) feathers."Some of these were very simple structures, without the branching complexity seen in birds today. We now know that many dinosaurs were warm blooded like birds and mammals, this meant that they could save energy by holding onto heat produced in their bodies. Scales are not good at this, and so there was a selective pressure to develop something like fur.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Feathers are highly complex natural structuresAs with mammalian fur, the early single-shafted feather growths prevented heat being conveyed away from the body in the air. But unlike fur, proto-feathers became more complex over evolutionary time, branching off with side veins and barbs, and developing extraordinary colours.Today, feathers are phenomenally useful to birds, and not just because they allow flight.Alongside the strong asymmetrical flight feathers, there are fluffy downy feathers that keep the animals warm, but in many birds, there are also feathers that grow continuously and break down into a powder that waterproofs the other feathers to keep them dry and buoyant. In others, long wire-like feathers grow like whiskers all over the body and feedback information about air-flow in the sky.Many of these extraordinary feather structures had already developed in their late ancestor dinosaurs. This was necessarily the case, because the complex, strong, asymmetrical feathers that are necessary for powered or even gliding flight in birds, existed at in the very first known bird ancestor, archaeopteryx, and all modern birds descended from a flying ancestor.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A diverse range of feathers enable birds to exploit different roles from attracting mates, to hovering or floatingBut flight was just one highly successful experiment with feathers.Modern feathers involve a range of different genes working together and being expressed at the right time and in the right space during the embryo's development. This new work helps to establish how feathers initially evolved, around 120 to 150 million years ago, but hints at five separate genetic processes active in birds that needed to work together to create modern feathers."In human evolution the great achievement is the brain, in birds it is the feathers," says Prof Chuong. Today his research is opening the door to understand how such a great achievement came about.There are practical implications of Prof Chuong's work. His team is working with plastic surgeons to help understand why skin structures don't develop well on scar tissue.This research informs our understanding of the process of how skin creates the structures that interact with the outside environment. With a better understanding of this, regenerative therapies could help people get better after accidents.The study is published in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution.Follow Rory on Twitter.
Seeds hold hidden treasures for future food
More than 70,000 seeds have been sent from Kew's Millennium Seed Bank to Lebanon, for vital crop research.
Image copyright Wolfgang Stuppy Image caption Seed vault at the Millennium Seed BankMore than 70,000 of the world's most precious seeds have been sent from the UK's Millennium Seed Bank to the Middle East, in its largest export to date.The consignment contains more than 50 wild relatives of cultivated crops, such as wheat, barley and lentils.The seeds will be used for food security research at a seed bank in Lebanon, which is recreating collections stranded in Syria.The Millennium Seed Bank at Kew is the world's largest wild plant seed bank.Seeds from the resilient, wild cousins of modern food crops are being collected and stored in an international effort.The aim is to breed new crop varieties capable of withstanding threats such as climate change, drought, pests and diseases.''The real importance of these crop wild relatives is that in order to survive in the world they've had to adapt to hostile environmental changes,'' said Oriole Wagstaff of the Crop Wild Relatives project at Kew's botanic garden at Wakehurst in Sussex.''With increasing pressures such as pests, diseases and climate change, we need to turn to these wild relatives, which have a much greater genetic diversity.''Image copyright Rossi Graziano Image caption Faba bean relative from ItalyThe seeds have been removed from stores at the Millennium Seed Bank and sent to the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (Icarda), in Lebanon.They include a wild wheat from Italy, a wild lentil plant from Cyprus, as well as wild relatives of the grass pea and faba bean.At Icarda, the seeds will be used for research into improving their domesticated relatives against current and future threats such as climate change.Hidden treasuresScientists at Icarda are re-building what was once the largest collection of seeds from across the region, including thousands of varieties of wheat, barley, lentils and fava (broadbean).These were kept at their former headquarters in Aleppo, where they are currently out of reach.Back-up samples held at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, deep inside a mountain in Norway, have helped to recreate the seed bank.The seeds from Kew will give researchers access to precious material from wild crops, enabling the genes of living crops to be compared with their wild ''cousins''.''These wild ones contain hidden treasures that might one day solve the threats crops are facing at the moment,'' Oriole Wagstaff added.The Crop Wild Relatives project is a global scheme that aims to collect, conserve and utilise the genetic diversity in the wild relatives of our domesticated crops to secure and improve food crops for the future.Marie Haga, chief executive of the Crop Trust, said conserving the diversity of our food crops ultimately safeguards the future of food for everyone.''Genebanks have a key role to play in this process,'' she said.''They conserve crop diversity and make it available to farmers and breeders around the world, providing the materials they need to ensure our food is plentiful, affordable, nutritious and varied."Image copyright Angelos Kyratzis Image caption Grass pea relative from Cyprus: Grass pea is cultivated mainly for its edible seeds which are typically consumed in sauces and soupsIt aims to:Identify where the wild relatives are found, which can be anywhere from the top of a mountain to an arid desertCollect themSafeguard them in the world's seed banksShare them under internationally agreed termsStart to use them to improve the varieties that we grow today.The seeds exported were collected from partners in Italy, Georgia, Cyprus, Portugal, Azerbaijan and Armenia.This work is supported by the government of Norway and managed by the Millennium Seed Bank Partnership of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew with the Global Crop Diversity Trust and implemented in partnership with national and international gene banks and plant breeding institutes around the world.All material collected within the project is available under the terms of the Standard Material Transfer Agreement (SMTA) within the framework of the multi-lateral system, as established under the International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA).Follow Helen on Twitter.
Three cups of coffee a day 'may have health benefits'
But there is no reason to start drinking coffee for health reasons, the BMJ study found.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The effects of caffeine can vary from person to personModerate coffee drinking is safe, and three to four cups a day may have some health benefits, according to a large review of studies, in the BMJ.It found a lower risk of liver disease and some cancers in coffee drinkers, and a lower risk of dying from stroke - but researchers could not prove coffee was the cause.Too much coffee during pregnancy could be harmful, the review confirmed.Experts said people should not start drinking coffee for health reasons.The University of Southampton researchers collected data on the impact of coffee on all aspects of the human body, taking into account more than 200 studies - most of which were observational.Compared with non-coffee drinkers, those who drank about three cups of coffee a day appeared to reduce their risk of getting heart problems or dying from them.The strongest benefits of coffee consumption were seen in reduced risks of liver disease, including cancer.But Prof Paul Roderick, co-author of the study, from the faculty of medicine at University of Southampton, said the review could not say if coffee intake had made the difference."Factors such as age, whether people smoked or not and how much exercise they took could all have had an effect," he said.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Everything in moderation, including coffeeThe findings back up other recent reviews and studies of coffee drinking so, overall, his message on coffee was reassuring."There is a balance of risks in life, and the benefits of moderate consumption of coffee seem to outweigh the risks," he said.The NHS recommends pregnant women have no more than 200mg of caffeine a day - two mugs of instant coffee - because too much can increase the risk of miscarriage.This review suggests women at risk of fractures should also cut back on coffee.For other adults, moderate caffeine intake equates to 400mg or less per day - or three to four cups of coffee - but that isn't the only drink (or food) to bear in mind.How much caffeine in my drink?one mug of filter coffee: 140mgone mug of instant coffee: 100mgone mug of tea: 75mgone can of cola: 40mgone 250ml can of energy drink: up to 80mgbar of plain chocolate: less than 25mgbar of milk chocolate: less than 10mgThe researchers say coffee drinkers should stick to "healthy coffees" - which avoid extra sugar, milk or cream, or a fatty snack on the side.And they are calling for rigorous clinical trials on coffee intake to find out more about the potential benefits to health.You might also be interested in:At present, the researchers said pinning down exactly how coffee might have a positive impact on health was "difficult" but it could be down to the effects of anti-oxidants and anti-fibrotics, which prevent or slow damage to cells in the body.Commenting on the BMJ review, Eliseo Guallar, from the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said there was still uncertainty about the effects of higher levels of coffee intake.But he added: "Moderate coffee consumption seems remarkably safe, and it can be incorporated as part of a healthy diet by most of the adult population."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Best not to opt for sticky, sweet snacks with your espressoTom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London, said coffee drinkers may be healthier people to start with - and that could skew the findings."Coffee is known to cause headaches in some people and it also increases the urge to go to the toilet - some people chose not to drink coffee for these reasons."Patients with abnormal heart rhythms are often advised to drink de-caffeinated coffee. Caffeine also acutely increases blood pressure, albeit transiently. "
Bizarre shape of interstellar asteroid
An asteroid that visited our Solar System from interstellar space is one of the most elongated celestial bodies known to science.
Image copyright ESO/M. Kornmesser Image caption Artwork: 'Oumuamua is now fading from the view of telescopesAn asteroid that visited us from interstellar space is one of the most elongated cosmic objects known to science, a study has shown.Discovered on 19 October, the object's speed and trajectory strongly suggested it originated in a planetary system around another star.Astronomers have been scrambling to observe the unique space rock, known as 'Oumuamua, before it fades from view.Their results so far suggest it is at least 10 times longer than it is wide.That ratio is more extreme than that of any asteroid or comet ever observed in our Solar System.Using observations from the Very Large Telescope in Chile, Karen Meech, from the Institute for Astronomy in Honolulu, Hawaii, and colleagues determined that the object was at least 400m long, rapidly rotating and subject to dramatic changes in brightness.These changes in brightness were the clue to 'Oumuamua's bizarre shape."Looking at the asteroid light curve database, there are five objects (out of 20,000) that have light curves that would suggest a shape up to an axis ratio of about 7-8 to 1," Dr Meech told BBC News."Our errors are very small, so we are confident this is really elongated. Also, one has to realise we don't know where the rotation pole is pointed. We assumed that it was perpendicular to the line of sight. If it were tipped over at all, then there are projection effects and the 10:1 is a minimum. It could be more elongated!"Image copyright NASA/JPL-Caltech/IAU Image caption The object's velocity and eccentric trajectory suggests it originated outside our Solar SystemBut in other respects, 'Oumuamua (pronounced oh MOO-uh MOO-uh), appears to resemble objects we know from closer to home."We also found that it had a reddish colour, similar to objects in the outer Solar System, and confirmed that it is completely inert, without the faintest hint of dust around it," Dr Meech said.These properties suggest that 'Oumuamua is dense, comprised of rock and possibly metals, has no water or ice, and that its surface was reddened due to the effects of irradiation from cosmic rays over long periods of time.Although 'Oumuamua formed around another star, scientists think it could have been wandering through the Milky Way, unattached to any star system, for hundreds of millions of years before its chance encounter with our Solar System."For decades we've theorised that such interstellar objects are out there, and now - for the first time - we have direct evidence they exist," said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for Nasa's science mission directorate in Washington DC."This history-making discovery is opening a new window to study formation of solar systems beyond our own."If planets form around other stars the same way they did in the Solar System, many objects the size of 'Oumuamua should get slung out into space. The interstellar visitor may provide the first evidence of that process.Image copyright ESO/F. Kamphues Image caption The Very Large Telescope in Chile was used for observationsAs regards how 'Oumuamua became so elongated, Dr Meech explained: "There has been speculation among various team members about this. Sometimes very elongated objects are contact binaries... but even so, the pieces would be longer than most things in the Solar System, and our analysis shows that it is rotating fast enough that they should not stay together."One of our team wondered if, during a planetary system formation, if there was a large collision between bodies that had molten cores, some material could get ejected out and then freeze in an elongated shape."Another team member was wondering if there could be some process during the ejection - say if there was a nearby supernova explosion that could be responsible."The cosmic interloper was discovered by Rob Weryk, a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Astronomy and a co-author of the new study, which is published in Nature journal.Weryk and fellow Institute for Astronomy researcher Marco Micheli realised it was going extremely fast (with enough speed to avoid being captured by the Sun's gravitational pull) and was on a very eccentric trajectory taking it out of our Solar System.The asteroid's name, 'Oumuamua, means "a messenger from afar arriving first" in Hawaiian.Follow Paul on Twitter.
Climate's magic rabbit: Pulling CO2 out of thin air
Can technology to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere really help prevent dangerous climate change?
Image copyright CLIMEWORKS Image caption The Climeworks installation sits on top of a recycling facility which provides heat to help run the systemUN climate negotiators are meeting in Bonn amid a welter of reports indicating that concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have broken records, while international attempts to curb greenhouse gases are not doing enough to avoid dangerous levels of warming. Our environment correspondent Matt McGrath has travelled to Switzerland to see if technology to remove CO2 from the air could be the answer to this ongoing carbon conundrum.While CO2 concentrations are now higher than they have been in at least 800,000 years, the gas still only accounts for a tiny 0.04% of our atmosphere.However, extracting carbon dioxide from well mixed air is not just technically difficult, it's expensive as well.A half-hour outside Zurich stands one of the frontline attempts to develop a commercial approach to sucking down CO2.On the roof of a large recycling centre at Hinwil stand 18 metal fans, stacked on top of each, each about the size of a large domestic washing machine.These fans suck in the surrounding air and chemically coated filters inside absorb the CO2. They become saturated in a few hours so, using the waste heat from the recycling facility, the filters are heated up to 100C and very pure carbon dioxide gas is then collected.This installation, called a direct-air capture system, has been developed by a Swiss company called Climeworks.It can capture about 900 tonnes of CO2 every year. It is then pumped to a large greenhouse a few hundred metres away, where it helps grow bigger vegetables.Image copyright Climeworks Image caption Air is sucked through fans and CO2 extracted via filtersThis is not supposed to be a demonstration of a clever technology - for the developers, making money from CO2 is critical."This is the first time we are commercially selling CO2; this is the first of its kind," co-founder Jan Wurzbacher told BBC News."It has to be for business; CO2 capture can't work for free."Right now Climeworks is selling the gas to the vegetable growers next door for less than $600 per tonne, which is very expensive.But the company says that this is because it has built its extraction devices from scratch - everything is bespoke. The firm believes that like solar and wind energy, costs will rapidly fall once production is scaled up."The magic number we always say is $100 per tonne," said Jan Wurzbacher."We have drawn a road down to the region of $100 and that is something we think is feasible. We can do it by scaling up the mass production of our components. I'd say half of the way to go there - we know what to do. We just have to do it over the next two or three years."Image copyright Climeworks Image caption Farmers say that their vegetables are 20% bigger thanks to the supply of CO2One of the things about CO2 that makes it attractive for developers is that it has many uses in the world.From fish food to concrete; from car seats to toothpaste - entrepreneurs are trying to use carbon dioxide as a raw material. There's also a roaring trade in CO2 in the US, where it's being used, without irony, to boost the extraction of oil from wells.One of the most ambitious plans is to extract CO2 and turn it into fuel.A couple of years ago, car manufacturer Audi announced it had developed what it called "e-diesel", a liquid fuel made from water and CO2. Climeworks supplied some of the CO2 for the trials. Driving down the price of capturing CO2 is key to making this idea work."If you have to pay $100 per tonne of CO2 that makes roughly 25 cents per litre of gasoline," said Jan Wurzbacher."It is a reasonable amount per litre or per kilogramme of natural gas."Making fuel or other products out of CO2 might help but it won't achieve the type of large scale take-down from the atmosphere that many scientists now fear will be necessary over the next 20-30 years if the goals of the Paris climate agreement are to be met.'Natural' solutionThe terms of the pact state that there needs to be a "balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases" in the second half of this century. To reach that balance, many experts believe we will have to resort to technological means of taking carbon out of the air."There are some things we can do in the real near-term but to get to zero emissions we will probably need some technologies to remove carbon from the atmosphere," Dr Glen Peters from the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research told BBC News."So we need to focus on getting things deployed that we know already work and at the same time we also need to focus on developing new technologies that will help us go the last part of the journey."Back in 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggested that BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) might be one way to do this. BECCS involves growing plants that suck down carbon, then burning them to make energy while capturing and burying the carbon that is released.Critics point out that to make a real impact with BECCS would take up way too much land that could be used for planting food.However, a recent study showed that a simpler approach, including planting more trees and better management of soils and grasslands, could actually make a significant difference.The report said that this could account for 37% of all actions needed by 2030 - the equivalent to China's current emissions from fossil fuel use.Image copyright Iain Smith Image caption In the UK, the Peterhead power plant was mooted as a site for a carbon-capture experiment but the government decided not to go aheadSo would the world be better off planting trees than waiting for Climeworks and others to perfect their technology?"We're not against trees," said Anka Timofte, an engineer with the company."It is all about the efficiency of the surface area that you are using. Our machine has a higher capacity of removing CO2 from the air and this CO2 can be re-used, and our machines are location-independent, so we could place them in the desert or anywhere there is an energy source."Climeworks has big ambitions. Recently it opened a plant in Iceland. CO2 is captured and buried underground where it will eventually turn to stone.The Swiss company wants to capture 1% of global emissions of CO2 by 2025. But to make a small dent in the global picture would require the use of 750,000 units similar to the one installed in Hinwil right now. It would also require huge amounts of energy to run these devices.'Magical techno-fixes'The Swiss company is not alone. There are similar efforts underway in Canada with a company called Carbon Engineering, and a Finnish-German consortium is also in the direct air-capture business.So plentiful are they becoming that environmental groups have started to map the progress of these and other geo-engineering projects that aim to curb climate change through technology.Many greens are deeply suspicious of these efforts. They argue that we need a fundamental rethink of the way that we produce and consume to put sustainability at the heart of everything we do."We need to step back and actually question what are all the possible pathways to a climate safe future," said Lili Fuhr from the Heinrich Böll Foundation."Have we seriously explored them and are they not more realistic than relying on these magical technologies that in my view hold immense risks and uncertainties and are certainly harmful for many people around the planet?"Other critics are worried that if the technology works, then it will encourage politicians not to make the cuts in carbon and rapidly move to renewable energy.Question of timeClimeworks' Jan Wurzbacher rejects this idea. He says it is all a matter of timing."If you had asked me 20 years ago I would have said that, yes, you should just focus on reducing emissions."But as of today we may have passed the point of being able to achieve it just by that. People say we will need to remove 10 gigatonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere every year by 2050. It's not enough to develop it then; you need to deploy it and scale it, and that will take 30 years!"Lili Fuhr doesn't agree. She says that approaches to capturing carbon are all part of a self-preservation strategy by the fossil fuel industry."For many decades the fossil fuel industry has funded climate sceptics and in that way tried to prevent climate action. But they've seen that is not working, so instead of denying, they are beginning to come up with these magical techno-fixes that would help prolong the lifespan of their industry."What we are seeing is a shift in the broader denial-ism and prevention strategy of the fossil fuel industry."Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook
Skylark: The unsung hero of British space
It’s 60 years to the day since the UK started launching its most successful rocket.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption From the archive, 2005: The final mission launched from SwedenIt's 60 years to the day that Britain launched its first Skylark rocket.It wasn't a big vehicle, and it didn't go to orbit. But the anniversary of that first flight from Woomera, Australia, should be celebrated because much of what we do in space today has its roots in this particular piece of technology."Skylark is an unsung British hero really," says Doug Millard, space curator at London's Science Museum."The first one was launched during the International Geophysical Year of 1957, and almost 450 were launched over the better part of half a century. It was the Skylark space rocket that really laid the foundations for everything the UK does in space."Millard is opening a corner of the museum's Space Gallery to the memory of the Skylark.Image copyright Science Museum GroupIt contains old rocket components and illustrations of the type of work in which the vehicle became engaged.That year, 1957, also saw the launch of the first satellite, the Soviets' Sputnik, so we really are talking about the beginning of the "space race".Skylark was what is called a sounding rocket. It would go just fast enough and high enough - a few hundred kilometres - to gather new data on the upper atmosphere or to observe space and its unique environment.At the top of the rocket's climb, for example, experiments would get a few minutes to sample what happens in weightlessness.Skylark was doing important pathfinder work on the UK's Blue Streak nuclear missile programme. And it was also performing novel types of astronomy by carrying up instruments that could sense deep space in ways that simply weren't possible from the ground.Many of the young researchers who cut their teeth on these early endeavours would go on to define British space activity in the years ahead."Almost all that I know about rocket science, I learnt from the Skylark programme," says John Zarnecki, who later worked on the Giotto comet-chaser, the Hubble space telescope, and the Huygens probe to Titan."The Skylark programme gave PhD students like myself the opportunity to be real rocket scientists. We were given enormous responsibility to run a small space project from the very start."The Skylark programme gave access to space for only a few minutes at a time. But it gave us a glimpse of the electromagnetic spectrum beyond the visible and helped to lay the foundations of the 'new astronomies', such as X-ray and ultraviolet which were to have such a major impact on astronomy over the last 50 years."Image copyright Science Museum GroupAnother Skylark veteran is Chris Rapley, a former director of the British Antarctic Survey and of the Science Museum itself.In the 1970s, he too was a PhD astronomer, at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory."The short timescales from proposing a Skylark mission to its launch - sometimes as little as two years - allowed new ideas and new technologies to be exploited on human timescales, and invoked a real sense of purpose and accomplishment."The downside was that the failure rate could be quite high. But the MSSL Director Prof Boyd (later Sir Robert Boyd) memorably said: 'If we are not suffering failures, we are not working at the edge, and if we are not working at the edge, we shouldn't be here'. It was more than career-forming; it was life-forming."Skylark was developed by the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough, in conjunction with the Rocket Propulsion Establishment at Westcott.The solid-fuel, plastic propellant motors were prepared by the Royal Ordnance Factory Bridgwater.One the preparation testing consoles is in the new Science Museum exhibition."It's just a riot of bakelite, dials, knobs and switches - it's real, unadulterated boffin territory," says Doug Millard.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Doug Millard: Testing console was "a riot of bakelite, dials, knobs and switches"Having been enthusiastically supported at the outset, the programme eventually lost favour in Whitehall and the last motors came off the production line in 1994.That wasn't an immediate end for Skylark because enough components had been stockpiled that flights could be continued through to 2005.The very last mission, on 2 May that year, was recorded by the BBC.You can see my colleague David Shukman's archive report from the Esrange space centre in Sweden on this page.In many ways, the Skylark's story mirrors that of British space activity itself: pioneering early days that were then followed by a period of neglect and decline.But as we remember this 60th anniversary, it's good to see UK space activity again in the ascendant. And it's remarkable to think rockets are once more being developed in this country.There are perhaps a dozen different projects being marshalled by start-ups right now.I can't say how many, if any, will match the 441 launches of the Skylark, but it's important to realise that spirit hasn't gone away.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Old footage of the Skylark rocket and its preparationJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos
The man who keeps venomous monsters
Nothing in your imagination can match some of the terrifying creatures that already exist in nature.
Those of a fragile disposition should not scroll down this page (spider alert!)Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ronald Jenner: "We want to give people a tension between fear and fascination"What is the most terrifying creature in the darkest corner of your imagination?I tell you now, it may have to go some to beat this beast.It's a disgusting worm-like organism that grabs you with four metal-reinforced jaws.Once latched in place, these lances inject you with a paralysing venom that also liquefies your flesh, which the worm then proceeds to suck up. Nice.Ok, the critter may not be much longer than your little finger, but the close-up image certainly makes the stomach churn.Image copyright NHM Image caption The "Gila monster" has led to a blockbuster drug that is now used to manage diabetesThe bloodworm is one of the many "stars" that will feature in an exhibition dedicated to venomous animals, set to open at London's Natural History Museum (NHM) next week.If you have an aversion to spiders, snakes, ants, wasps, scorpions, and even to the unassuming platypus (yes, it's also venomous) - then I suggest you don't go.But if you're fascinated by evolution and some of the remarkable biochemistry it's managed to cook up over the last half-a-billion years - you're unlikely to be disappointed.And the truth is, we can't escape what's all around us anyway. They say you're never more than six feet from a rat. Well, the same is equally true of venomous creatures or the products and services they provide to us.It's time to face and love the horror.Image copyright NHM Image caption The worm with a Halloween mask: Bloodworms are a favourite of neuroscientists"If you eat fruit; well, they're pollinated by bees, which are venomous," says Dr Ronald Jenner, the NHM's venom evolution expert."Figs are pollinated by parasitoid wasps. If you eat squid or octopus - they're venomous."They use venoms in cosmetics - face-masks use a synthetic version of a snake peptide that relaxes the muscles."You may not know this but your diabetes medicine is most likely a synthetic version of a toxin."The red wine you drink has been clarified often with the swim bladders of venomous catfish. They don't put it on the label, but venom's tendrils are in your life."The cotton clothes you wear - the only reason we can grow the cotton in such large monocultures is because parasitoid wasps take out all the sap-sucking insects that would otherwise damage the crop. Without venom, we'd be scuppered."Image copyright NHM Image caption Vampire bats' venom keeps the blood flowing in their victimsIt's hard not to be enthused by Ronald when he takes you on a tour of his favourite NHM monsters.Thankfully, they're all dead and a good many are behind glass, submerged in preserving liquid, which means you can get a very close look at their weaponry.Venom is a toxin - usually a kind of peptide or large protein - that is actively delivered through a wound via a specialised mechanism, involving teeth, fangs, claws, spurs or a stinger. Believe it or not, there's even a newt that does it with its ribs. It breaks them first, pokes them through glands in its skin and then injects its foe.Image copyright NHM Image caption Masters of the Halloween costume competition: Velvet ants are actually waspsRonald works a lot with that ugly bloodworm - or the "worm with a Halloween mask", as he calls it.It delivers a neurotoxin that has found use in labs across the world to study nerve cell communication."When the bloodworm injects a crustacean prey, it causes a spastic paralysis. But what's remarkable is that this effect is reversible," he explains."Scientists have fractionated the venom to get just that bit that activates cell communication channels. They apply it to the cell culture, study the process of communication, and then wash the effect away with a buffer. It was only this year that we've seen the full molecular structure of this protein and it's huge and unlike anything else in nature."Image copyright NHM Image caption An Egyptian cobra's paralysing venom can kill but some prey have now evolved resistanceSome venoms will jellify the blood so the victim will suffer clots, leading to stroke and rapid death. Some venoms act as an anti-clotting agent. Vampire bats use this strategy so they can keep on sucking from a wound.As gory as all this is, it's easy to see the enormous pharmaceutical potential.The most famous example is probably the Brazilian pit viper whose venom is able to rapidly lower the blood pressure of its victims so they pass out and drop to the ground.The snake's venom showed scientists the way to some of the first angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to treat high-blood pressure in humans.Image copyright NHM Image caption Peacock spider: Nearly every arachnid is venomousThen there's the "Gila monster". Its painful bite incorporates a peptide that regulates glucose.AstraZeneca markets a drug based on this molecule called Exenatide, which is used to manage Type II diabetes. Its value runs to hundreds of millions of dollars a year.Of course, everyone wants to know what is the most lethal member in Ronald's collection. "I always get asked what is the worst of the worst", he says.Comparing venoms is not straightforward because this form of chemical warfare can be highly specialised: what works on one type of prey may be much less effective on another. But the NHM expert clearly has a soft spot for the coastal taipan snake, which is found on the northern coast of Australia and in New Guinea.Image copyright NHM Image caption The komodo dragon uses venom to lower the blood pressure of its victim, inducing shockIn toxinology, researchers use a measure called the "median lethal dose" to describe a venom's power."If the total yield of the strongest venom ever measured in a taipan was delivered in a full bite - that could kill 50% of 3.3 million mice. That's insane," says Ronald.Venom delivery as a means to take down prey or to defend against predation has evolved independently about 90 times in nature and now includes some 200,000 living species.That is testament to venom's usefulness. And almost every animal would have the genetic toolkit to evolve the capability."You could even make humans venomous," chuckles Ronald. "It would involve selective breeding and might take two millions years - but you could definitely do it. Our saliva would be a good place to start."Venom: Killer and Cure opens at the Natural History Museum on Friday, 10 November.Image copyright NHM Image caption Venom is a toxin that is actively delivered via specialised mechanismImage copyright NHMJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos
Avatar therapy 'reduces power of schizophrenia voices'
Patients became less distressed and heard voices less often compared with those who had counselling.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How avatar therapy is helping people stand up to schizophrenic voices by giving them a faceConfronting an avatar on a computer screen helped patients hearing voices to cope better with hallucinations, a UK trial has found.Patients who received this therapy became less distressed and heard voices less often compared with those who had counselling instead.Experts said the therapy could add an important new approach to treating schizophrenia hallucinations.The trial, on 150 people, is published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal.It follows a much smaller pilot study in 2013.Hallucinations are common in people with schizophrenia and can be threatening and insulting.One in four patients continues to experience voices despite being treated with drugs and cognitive behavioural therapy.In this study, run by King's College London and University College London, 75 patients who had continued to hear voices for more than a year, were given six sessions of avatar therapy while another 75 received the same amount of counselling.In the avatar sessions, patients created a computer simulation to represent the voice they heard and wanted to control, including how it sounded and how it might look.Image copyright King's College London Image caption Three avatars created by people taking part in the therapyThe therapist then voiced the avatar while also speaking as themselves in a three-way conversation to help the patient gain the upper hand.Prof Tom Craig, study author from King's College London, said getting patients to learn to stand up to the avatar was found to be safe, easy to deliver and twice as effective as counselling at reducing how often voices were heard."After 12 weeks there was dramatic improvement compared to the other therapy," he said."With a talking head, patients are learning to confront and get replies from it."This shifts the idea that the voice is all-controlling," he said.Patients are encouraged to talk to the avatar and take control of the conversation, saying things such as, "I'm not going to listen to you any more."Seven patients who had had the avatar therapy and two from the counselling group said their hallucinations had completely disappeared after 12 weeks.Image copyright King's College London Image caption Prof Tom Craig acted as therapist and voiced the avatar in the therapy sessionsBy 24 weeks, however, the patients in both groups had shown the same levels of improvement, suggesting the avatar therapy required booster sessions in the long term, the study said.Prof Craig said the next step was to find out if the therapy worked in other locations before it could be made widely available on the NHS, but he said the findings were a "significant advance" in treating hallucinations.Prof Stephen Lawrie, head of psychiatry at the University of Edinburgh, said the trial was impressive and robust but more work was needed."Further study is required to replicate these results, establish the role of such treatment versus others such as CBT [cognitive behavioural therapy], and clarify who might benefit most."'Promising'Sir Robin Murray, professor of psychiatric research at King's College London's Institute of Psychiatry, said that if they could be reproduced, the findings "will add an important new approach to care".He added: "If a wholly psychological intervention such as avatar therapy can produce such an improvement, then it should make us rethink the way we conceptualise auditory hallucinations."Brian Dow, from charity Rethink Mental Illness, said he welcomed any attempts to try and develop new and innovative treatments for schizophrenia."Hallucinations can be extremely traumatising for patients who experience them and the results of the this trial are promising."
Three cups of coffee a day 'may have health benefits'
But there is no reason to start drinking coffee for health reasons, the BMJ study found.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The effects of caffeine can vary from person to personModerate coffee drinking is safe, and three to four cups a day may have some health benefits, according to a large review of studies, in the BMJ.It found a lower risk of liver disease and some cancers in coffee drinkers, and a lower risk of dying from stroke - but researchers could not prove coffee was the cause.Too much coffee during pregnancy could be harmful, the review confirmed.Experts said people should not start drinking coffee for health reasons.The University of Southampton researchers collected data on the impact of coffee on all aspects of the human body, taking into account more than 200 studies - most of which were observational.Compared with non-coffee drinkers, those who drank about three cups of coffee a day appeared to reduce their risk of getting heart problems or dying from them.The strongest benefits of coffee consumption were seen in reduced risks of liver disease, including cancer.But Prof Paul Roderick, co-author of the study, from the faculty of medicine at University of Southampton, said the review could not say if coffee intake had made the difference."Factors such as age, whether people smoked or not and how much exercise they took could all have had an effect," he said.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Everything in moderation, including coffeeThe findings back up other recent reviews and studies of coffee drinking so, overall, his message on coffee was reassuring."There is a balance of risks in life, and the benefits of moderate consumption of coffee seem to outweigh the risks," he said.The NHS recommends pregnant women have no more than 200mg of caffeine a day - two mugs of instant coffee - because too much can increase the risk of miscarriage.This review suggests women at risk of fractures should also cut back on coffee.For other adults, moderate caffeine intake equates to 400mg or less per day - or three to four cups of coffee - but that isn't the only drink (or food) to bear in mind.How much caffeine in my drink?one mug of filter coffee: 140mgone mug of instant coffee: 100mgone mug of tea: 75mgone can of cola: 40mgone 250ml can of energy drink: up to 80mgbar of plain chocolate: less than 25mgbar of milk chocolate: less than 10mgThe researchers say coffee drinkers should stick to "healthy coffees" - which avoid extra sugar, milk or cream, or a fatty snack on the side.And they are calling for rigorous clinical trials on coffee intake to find out more about the potential benefits to health.You might also be interested in:At present, the researchers said pinning down exactly how coffee might have a positive impact on health was "difficult" but it could be down to the effects of anti-oxidants and anti-fibrotics, which prevent or slow damage to cells in the body.Commenting on the BMJ review, Eliseo Guallar, from the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said there was still uncertainty about the effects of higher levels of coffee intake.But he added: "Moderate coffee consumption seems remarkably safe, and it can be incorporated as part of a healthy diet by most of the adult population."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Best not to opt for sticky, sweet snacks with your espressoTom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London, said coffee drinkers may be healthier people to start with - and that could skew the findings."Coffee is known to cause headaches in some people and it also increases the urge to go to the toilet - some people chose not to drink coffee for these reasons."Patients with abnormal heart rhythms are often advised to drink de-caffeinated coffee. Caffeine also acutely increases blood pressure, albeit transiently. "
Outrage after India minister terms cancer 'divine justice'
An Indian minister's remark about the disease "saddens" patients and their family members.

Sometimes we come across young men getting inflicted with cancer or young men meeting with accidents. If you observe the background you will come to know that it's divine justice. Nothing else. We have to suffer that divine justice," The Times of India quoted him as saying.His statement has angered many on Twitter.Skip Twitter post by @Smita_Sharma I don’t tweet about personal issues.But I have to say this-my niece was only 11yrs old when she lost her father to cancer.Innumerable families have gone through the unspeakable pain & trauma of Cancer.I wouldn’t wish it even upon worst enemies.Shame on you Mr.Min @himantabiswa https://t.co/eatFK35fsK — Smita Sharma (@Smita_Sharma) November 22, 2017 ReportMr Sharma, who is a member of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), later tweeted a defiant clarification, which has only angered people further.Skip Twitter post by @himantabiswa Did my speech was on cancer?

Young people 'experimenting more in bed'
Study reveals increasing diversity in young people's heterosexual practices.
Image copyright Getty ImagesYoung people are taking part in a wider range of sexual practices, including anal sex, with opposite sex partners, research reveals.Experts looked at responses to a national sex survey that has been carried out every 10 years since 1990 in the UK.More than one in 10 millennial teenagers said they had tried anal sex by the age of 18.By the age of 22 to 24, three in every 10 said they had tried it.Vaginal and oral sex are still the most common types of sexual activity between young men and women, however.The age that young people start having sex - vaginal, anal or oral - has not changed much in recent decades.In the most recent survey, it was 16.While the study in the Journal of Adolescent Health shows what types of sex people are having, it doesn't shed light on why preferences are changing.Experts can only speculate, but say society has become more accepting and less judgemental about sexual experimentation.Breaking down taboosKaye Wellings, senior author and professor of sexual and reproductive health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: "The changes in practices we see here are consistent with the widening of other aspects of young people's sexual experience, and are perhaps not surprising given the rapidly changing social context and the ever-increasing number of influences on sexual behaviour."Prof Cynthia Graham is a professor in sexual and reproductive health at the University of Southampton.She said the internet and media might have played a role in breaking down sexual taboos."The internet means people can easily find and see things that they would not have been able to in the past."Anal sex is still pretty stigmatised, but attitudes appear to be changing. We know society has become more accepting of things like same sex behaviour overall. But there's very little research out there about anal sex and motivation."She said more studies were needed to inform sex education and equip young people with the information they need for their sexual health.
NHS overcharged by millions for key drug, says watchdog
A 6,000% price rise in an essential thyroid drug led the NHS to overpay, the UK competition body says.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dr Mark Vanderpump told the BBC patients were seeing liothyronine sold for £5 in other European citiesDrug company Concordia overcharged the NHS by millions for a key thyroid treatment, the Competition and Markets Authority has provisionally found.The CMA said that last year the NHS spent £34m on its drug, liothyronine, up from about £600,000 in 2006.The amount the NHS paid per pack rose from around £4.46 in 2007 to £258.19 by July 2017, an increase of almost 6,000%.Concordia said it did "not believe that competition law has been infringed".The price change occurred in the years after the drug was de-branded in 2007. The CMA said the price rise took place despite "broadly stable" production costs.Canadian drugs giant Concordia sells drugs to patients in more than 100 countries.Liothyronine tablets are primarily used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone affecting at least two in every 100 people and which can lead to depression, tiredness and weight gain.Until earlier this year, Concordia was the only supplier of the drug.CMA chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, said: "Pharmaceutical companies which abuse their position and overcharge for drugs are forcing the NHS - and the UK taxpayer - to pay over the odds for important medical treatments."We allege that Concordia used its market dominance in the supply of liothyronine tablets to do exactly that."Analysis: Michelle Roberts, BBC News Online health editorImage copyright PAPrescription medicines that are still under patent can be expensive, but the government caps profits from any that are sold to the NHS to keep costs low.But this system does not cover so-called "generic medicines", where a drug's patent has run out.The loophole means the price of older, established drugs coming off patent can rocket.A company, after filing and obtaining appropriate approval, can start trading the rebranded medicine and set a high price for it through a process known as "debranding".It's something the Competition and Markets Authority has challenged a number of drugs companies over.'Open and transparent'Mr Coscelli stressed that, at this stage in the investigation, the findings were provisional and there had been no definitive decision that there had been a breach of competition law.Concordia said the pricing of liothyronine had been conducted "openly and transparently with the Department of Health in the UK over a period of 10 years"."Over that time, significant investment has been made in this medicine to ensure its continued availability for patients in the UK."We continue to work co-operatively with the CMA as it proceeds with its investigation."It added that the CMA's statement included matters that pre-dated Concordia's ownership of its international segment, which it bought in 2015 from investment firm Cinven and other sellers, including Hg Capital. The CMA has also written to those two firms."I get some from Greece, some from Mexico"Image copyright Tara RiddleBefore she started taking liothyronine, Tara Riddle said her life was "utter, utter exhaustion".She told BBC 5 live: "I had to lean on something, rather than stand, I couldn't go out, I couldn't shop. It was awful, absolutely awful."Having researched her condition online she convinced her GP to prescribe her liothyronine which she took for four weeks."My life came back completely," she said. "Then I called my GP and he said 'I am so, so glad, but I'm afraid I am not allowed to to give you any more because they are so expensive.'"Tara is now forced to buy the drug overseas via the internet.She said: "I get some from Greece, some from Mexico. I talked to my MP about it and he said they could be dirty drugs, and I said I know, but I said I wasn't going to go back to that bad place I was in."The NHS is paying around £900 for 100 tablets, and in Greece and Turkey they can be got for about £3. The NHS is paying way, way too much and there's something wrong."'Massive difference'An NHS England spokesperson said: "This action sends an important enforcement signal to relevant generic drug manufacturers, and also wholesalers, that taxpayers and the NHS will not tolerate market abuses."Dr Mark Vanderpump, former president of the British Thyroid Association, explained how he saw the cost of liothyronine rocket: "Historically the drug cost the NHS about £20-30 a month. The new cost was over £300 a month."Patients were telling me they could go to a foreign capital and pay about £4-5 a month, so there was a massive difference in what the NHS was being charged versus what people were accessing it at at a European level."If the provisional finding is upheld the CMA can impose a fine of up to 10% of Concordia's annual worldwide turnover.Earlier this year, Concordia was also accused of pushing up the price of a "lifesaving" NHS drug by striking a deal not to compete with another firm.The CMA said in provisional findings that Actavis and Concordia fixed the market for hydrocortisone tablets. Concordia also said then it did not think it was in breach of competition law.More investigationsThe CMA said the liothyronine case was one of a number it was looking at within the pharmaceutical sector.Previously, the watchdog has fined drugs giant Pfizer and Flynn Pharma nearly £90m in relation to what it called "excessive and unfair prices" for the anti-epilepsy treatment, phenytoin sodium capsules.It also fined a number of pharmaceutical companies a total of £45m in relation to anti-depressant medicine paroxetine.Both those decisions are under appeal.The CMA is pursuing another seven investigations into several companies in relation to drug pricing and competition issues.
Minimum alcohol pricing in Scotland to start in May
The move will raise the cost of the strongest, cheapest alcohol by setting a minimum price of 50p-per-unit.
Minimum alcohol pricing in Scotland to start in MayFrom the section Scotland politicsImage copyright PA Image caption The policy is largely aimed at cheap, high-strength alcohol in supermarkets and off-licences Scotland will introduce minimum pricing for alcohol on 1 May next year, the Scottish government has announced. The move will raise the cost of the strongest, cheapest alcohol by setting a minimum price per unit. Health Secretary Shona Robison told MSPs that she expected the price to be set at 50p-per-unit, but this will be subject to a consultation. She said the measure was needed to tackle the "devastation" caused by cheap, high-strength alcohol. The 50p-per-unit minimum would raise the price of the cheapest bottle of red wine (9.4 units of alcohol) to £4.69, while a four-pack of 500ml cans of 4% lager (8 units) would cost at least £4 and a 70cl bottle of whisky (28 units of alcohol) could not be sold for less than £14. Normal strength cider (5% ABV) would cost at least £2.50 a litre but a super-strength version (7.5% ABV) would have to cost a minimum of £3.75 for a litre. Key weapon Minimum pricing is largely aimed at cheap lager, cider and spirits sold in supermarkets and off-licences. But it would leave more expensive drinks unaffected, and is unlikely to impact on sales in pubs and clubs. The Scottish government views the measure as a key weapon in the battle against binge drinking, with people in Scotland said to buy 20% more alcohol on average than those in England and Wales. Alcohol Focus Scotland research from last year suggested that the maximum recommended weekly intake of alcohol - 14 units - could be bought for just £2.52, with super-strength cider and own-brand vodka and whisky available from as little as 18p per unit of alcohol.Minimum pricing for alcohol Examples of prices £14 Whisky (70cl bottle at 40% ABV) £13.13 Vodka (70cl bottle at 37.5% ABV)£1 Lager (500ml can at 4% ABV)£2.50 Cider (1 litre bottle at 5% - normal strength)£4.69 Red wine (75cl bottle at 12.5% ABV)The Scottish Parliament passed the minimum pricing legislation five years ago but it was tied up in a legal challenge by the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) until last week, when the Supreme Court ruled that it did not breach EU law.Judges ruled unanimously that the policy was a "proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim" - with the SWA agreeing to pay the Scottish government's legal costs.Minimum pricing has been broadly welcomed by health bodies and alcohol awareness groups, who say it will target the kind of drinking that leads to the greatest harm.There were 1,265 alcohol-related deaths in Scotland last year, an increase of 10% on 2015 - figures which Ms Robison described as "completely unacceptable".Image caption Ms Robison confirmed the start date in the Scottish ParliamentSpeaking in the Scottish Parliament, the health secretary said the delays to minimum pricing meant lives had been lost that might not have been, and stressed her commitment to implementing the policy "as soon as it is practicable".She said: "With alcohol on sale today at just 18p a unit, we have to act to tackle the scourge of cheap, high-strength drink that causes so much damage."Ms Robison said research had shown that a minimum unit price of 50p would cut alcohol-related deaths by 392 and hospital admissions by 8,254 over the first five years of the policy.She added: "I anticipate setting the minimum unit price at 50p per unit. We now want to hear from retailers, representative bodies and Licensing Standards Officers about the practicalities of implementation."All additional money raised by the increase in pricing will be kept by the retailer.The legislation has a "sunset clause", which means it will be reviewed after five years before a decision is taken on whether it should continue, and in what form.What has been the reaction?While welcoming the confirmation that the policy will finally be implemented, some people have questioned whether the 50p minimum price - which was recommended five years ago - will be enough to achieve the policy's objectives.Dr Chris Holmes from Sheffield University, who carried out much of the initial research into minimum pricing, told BBC Scotland that there was now "certainly an argument for looking at a higher level" than 50p.He explained: "When we first did this work, around three-quarters of alcohol in Scotland was sold for less than 50p per unit; today it's around half of all alcohol."So there is an argument that the Scottish government may want to look at whether and when to increase the minimum price threshold to ensure it retains its effectiveness."Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw also welcomed Ms Robison's announcement, but said there had to be a discussion around the 50p rate.He asked: "Not only is that figure now five years old, but will it be suitable for another five years as this policy develops?"Scottish Labour's Colin Smyth highlighted new figures which he said showed that alcohol-related hospital admissions are eight times higher among people from the most deprived communities.Calling for "real change" to tackle Scotland's drinking culture, he said: "The reality is the SNP has slashed funding for alcohol and drug partnerships by 24% in recent years, cutting support for people including the poorest in the most deprived communities."Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie is among those to have call for a 60p minimum price, which he said would reflect the impact of inflation and other factors over the past five years.
Women advised to sleep on side to help prevent stillbirth

I think that's really scary because you have to sleep."So I think having clear things that can help you feel a bit more in control is really important for women."
Breast cancer tumours 'larger' in overweight women
Women with a higher body mass index might need more frequent mammograms, researchers suggest.
Image copyright Getty ImagesCancerous breast lumps are less likely to be detected in overweight or obese women before the tumour becomes large, a Swedish study has found.These women may need more frequent mammograms to help spot early tumours, say researchers, but experts say more evidence is needed.In the UK, women aged 50-70 are invited for screening every three years.Some women judged to be at higher risk of breast cancer are already offered more frequent screening.This might be a woman with a strong family history of breast cancer, for example.Being overweight also increases a woman's risk of developing breast cancer, but it is not currently considered for setting breast screening intervals.Obesity riskThe Karolinksa Institute study involved 2,012 women who developed breast cancer between 2001 and 2008.The women had been receiving mammograms every 18 months to two years, as standard in Sweden.The researchers looked at how large the tumours were at diagnosis, as well as the women's body mass index (BMI), a measure of obesity.The team found women who were overweight were more likely to have a larger tumour when detected either at their mammogram or between screenings.This might be because their breasts were larger and therefore the tumour was harder to find, or because their tumours grew at a faster rate, the study's lead author Fredrik Strand told the BBC.Larger tumours tend to carry a worse prognosis.More frequent screeningsDr Strand said: "Our study suggests that when a clinician presents the pros and cons of breast cancer screening to the patient, having high BMI should be an important 'pro' argument."In addition, our findings suggest that women with high BMI should consider shorter time intervals between screenings."But Sophia Lowes, from Cancer Research UK, said the study, which is being presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America, did not provide enough evidence to support changing how often women are screened."Breast screening has harms as well as benefits."It saves lives by helping detect breast cancer at an early stage, but harms include some women being diagnosed with a cancer that would never have caused them problems in their lifetime."The time between screening is designed to help the benefits outweigh the harms overall."

Some cancer patients have PTSD years after diagnosis, study finds
A fifth of cancer patients experience post-traumatic stress disorder.
Image copyright Carine Bea Image caption Becki McGuinness suffers from PTSD after her cancer treatment left her infertileA fifth of cancer patients experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a Malaysian study has found.About one-third of these still had consistent or worsening PTSD four years after diagnosis.The researchers said PTSD needed to be identified, monitored and treated early.Becki McGuinness, who was diagnosed with bone cancer, said the resulting PTSD and depression were the biggest challenges for her.Becki was treated with chemotherapy after being diagnosed at the age of 21. When it didn't work, she was told she would need radiotherapy."By the time I'd finished radiotherapy, and a few months passed, my periods were stopping."It wasn't until I was 23 that I found out that I'd gone through the menopause and was infertile," she said.'I could have saved your fertility'Becki was devastated - even more so when she found out it could have been prevented."I was waiting a whole month for my treatment. I later saw a gynaecologist who said, 'If you'd only been sent to me I could have saved your fertility.'"It left her with depression and PTSD, which she still lives with seven years on."I could take all the physical stuff. I could take even that I might die but when something's taken away and it's not your choice, that's what I find quite stressful."If you take that person's choice away, it's like saying you're not worth picking for yourself what you want for your future."Image copyright Carine BeaThe team followed 469 patients with various types of cancer at one referral centre in Malaysia.They tested them for PTSD after six months and then again four years after they'd been diagnosed. At six months, 21% had PTSD. This dropped to 6% four years on."Many cancer patients believe they need to adopt a 'warrior mentality', and remain positive and optimistic from diagnosis through treatment to stand a better chance of beating their cancer," said the study's lead author, Caryn Mei Hsien Chan."To these patients, seeking help for the emotional issues they face is akin to admitting weakness."There needs to be greater awareness that there is nothing wrong with getting help to manage the emotional upheaval - particularly depression, anxiety, and PTSD post-cancer."While the association between PTSD and cancer hasn't been studied in the UK, government data shows one in five people with cancer report having moderate to severe mental health issues. Macmillan Cancer Support estimates this to be about 530,000 people with cancer in the UK.Living in fearDr Chan also stressed that many patients lived in fear that their cancer may return.The fear and depression can cause them to skip appointments as they trigger negative memories, which can be detrimental to their health.The study also found patients with breast cancer - who received special dedicated support and counselling at the centre studied - were almost four times less likely to develop PTSD in the short term.Dr Chan said: "We need psychological evaluation and support services for patients with cancer at an initial stage and at continued follow-ups because psychological well-being and mental health - and by extension, quality of life - are just as important as physical health."Dany Bell from Macmillan Cancer Support said: "It is tragic, but sadly not surprising, that so many people with cancer suffer from PTSD."While a common perception is that people should feel 'lucky' to have survived cancer, we often hear from people who felt that the support they received 'dropped away' when their treatment ended. The health and care system has a long way to go in terms of supporting people after cancer treatment."CampaigningBecki couldn't agree more. She said her mental health support was inadequate and the consequences remain with her."You see children and you try and block it out but realise the depression is something that will keep popping up," she said.Her cancer is now in remission but she stills lives in a lot of pain that prevents her from working.She devotes time to campaigning for awareness for fertility preservation, to make sure others don't have to go through what she has.Becki said: "That's given me the empowerment to deal with it a lot better than if I'd been sitting at home, thinking about it."I'll keep raising the issue to make sure young people get their needs met."
Indulgent grandparents 'bad for children's health'
Regular "treating" and over-feeding is a common issue, according to a review of parents' opinions.
Image copyright SolStockIndulgent grandparents may be having an adverse impact on their grandchildren's health, say researchers.The University of Glasgow study, published in PLOS One journal, suggests grandparents are often inclined to treat and overfeed children.The study also found some were smoking in front of their grandchildren and not giving them sufficient exercise.But Maureen Lipman, a grandmother of two, said: "The grandparents' job is always definitely to indulge."The researchers looked at 56 studies with data from 18 countries, including the UK, US, China and Japan.The report focused on the potential influence of grandparents who were significant - but not primary - caregivers in a child's early years.The review considered three key areas of influence:diet and weightphysical activitysmokingImage copyright Getty ImagesIn terms of both diet and weight, the report concluded that grandparents' behaviour had an adverse effect.Grandparents were characterised by parents as "indulgent" and "misinformed", and accused of using food as an emotional tool.Many studies found they were inclined to feed grandchildren high-sugar or high-fat foods - often in the guise of a treat.Parents felt unable to interfere because they were reliant on grandparents helping them out.The study also found that grandchildren were perceived to be getting too little exercise while under the care of their grandparents.Physical activity levels appeared to be related to whether grandparents were active themselves, or whether there was appropriate space where children could be active.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Maureen Lipman likes giving her grandchildren ice cream and jellyBut actress Maureen Lipman said there was a big difference between grandparents who looked after their grandchildren everyday compared to those who see them at the weekends."If you're seeing them once a week you're going to overindulge but if you work with them every day, you're going to treat them as your own children," she said.She keeps turkey dinosaurs in the freezer for her grandchildren Ava and Sacha and likes giving them ice cream with jelly."I try with the vegetables and fail," she said. "You can't train other people's children.""The grandparents' job is kind of to be in cahoots with the grandchildren against the parents."She said being a mother could be "quite challenging", but being a grandmother was "just pure pleasure".Ms Lipman said: "It's a walking miracle that you've brought something into the world that's brought something into the world."She's also conscious of an "unspoken rivalry"."There are two sets of grandparents - and you don't want to be the one that isn't giving them the nice piece of cake."'Unintentional'In the study, smoking around the children, even when they had been asked not to, became an area of conflict between grandparents and parents.Conversely, in certain cases, the birth of a grandchild became a catalyst to a grandparent giving up smoking - or changing their habits.Lead researcher Dr Stephanie Chambers said: "From the studies we looked at, it appears that parents often find it difficult to discuss the issues of passive smoking and over-treating grandchildren."While the results of this review are clear that behaviour such as exposure to smoking and regularly treating children increases cancer risks as children grow into adulthood, it is also clear from the evidence that these risks are unintentional."Given that many parents now rely on grandparents for care, the mixed messages about health that children might be getting is perhaps an important discussion that needs to be had."'Healthy habits'According to Grandparents Plus, grandparents are "the largest provider of informal childcare" in the UK and they need to be "better recognised and supported".The charity's chief executive, Lucy Peake, said: "Grandparents want the best for their grandchildren, and the more they're informed and enabled to play a positive role in their grandchildren's lives the better things will be."We know that children benefit enormously from having close relationships with their grandparents right through childhood into adolescence."What this study shows is that the role they're playing in children's lives needs to be better recognised and supported."We'd like to see more focus on ensuring that information available to parents about children's health reaches grandparents too."Prof Linda Bauld, from Cancer Research UK, which part-funded the study, said: "With both smoking and obesity being the two biggest preventable causes of cancer in the UK, it's important for the whole family to work together."If healthy habits begin early in life, it's much easier to continue them as an adult."
First gene-editing in human body attempt
Gene-editing has been attempted on cells inside a patient, in a world first by doctors in California.
Image copyright Children's Hospital Oakland Image caption Brian Madeux and his fiancé Marcie HumphreyGene-editing has been attempted on cells inside a patient, in a world first by doctors in California.Brian Madeux, 44 from Arizona, was given the experimental treatment to try to correct a defect in his DNA that causes Hunter's syndrome.Mr Madeux says he was prepared to take part in the trial as he is "in pain every second of the day".It is too soon to know whether or not the gene-editing has worked in Mr Madeux's case.Hunter's syndrome is rare. Patients are born without the genetic instructions for an enzyme that breaks down long sugary molecules called mucopolysaccharides.Instead, they build up in the body and damage the brain and other organs. Severe cases are often fatal."I actually thought I wouldn't live past my early 20s," said Mr Madeux.Patients need regular enzyme replacement therapy to break down the mucopolysaccharides.Image copyright Children's Hospital OaklandBut Mr Madeux has been given an experimental treatment to rewrite his DNA to give him the instructions for making the enzyme.The therapy was infused into his bloodstream on Monday at Oakland's UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital.The therapy contains two molecular scissors - called zinc finger nucleases - that cut the DNA at a precise spot.This creates an opening for a new piece of DNA, containing the desired instructions, to be inserted into the patient's genetic code.The genetic therapy has been designed so it becomes active only once it gets inside Mr Madeux's liver cells.Dr Chester Whitley, one of the doctors working on the trial, told the BBC: "If works as well as it does in mice, this has huge ramifications."I'm very optimistic we have a both safe and efficacious way of providing gene therapy."His long-term hope is to perform gene-editing shortly after birth, because an "untreated baby loses 20 IQ points per year".Image copyright Children's Hospital OaklandGene editing has been tried in people before, but cells have been taken out of the body, edited, checked for errors and then placed back in.That works for tissues that can be temporally removed and returned at a later date like a sample of bone marrow.However, such an approach is impossible for organs like the liver, heart or brain. It is why doctors have attempted the gene editing inside the patient's body.The trial is testing only the safety of performing the gene editing and it will require more research to know if it could be a valid therapy.So far there have been no side effects in Mr Madeux and if everything continues to go well, then up to nine patients will receive the experimental procedure as part of the study.'New frontier'Dr Sandy Macrae, from Sangamo Therapeutics, which designed the therapy, said: "For the first time, a patient has received a therapy intended to precisely edit the DNA of cells directly inside the body."We are at the start of a new frontier of genomic medicine."Further safety trials using the same technology to treat haemophilia B and Hurler syndrome are also planned.Mr Madeux says he is prepared to have his DNA altered "if it will prolong my life and help scientists find cures for humankind".Follow James on Twitter.
Choice of tipple 'determines different moods'
Spirits may make you angry or tearful, while red wine or beer may make you relax, research says.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Do you know how alcohol changes your mood?Different types of alcoholic drink change and shape your mood in different ways, says a study into drinking and emotions.Spirits may make you feel angry, sexy or tearful, while red wine or beer may make you feel relaxed, say researchers.They questioned nearly 30,000 people aged 18-34 from 21 different countries for the study in the journal BMJ Open.All the respondents drank beer, wine and spirits, and many said each type of alcohol had a different effect on them.While having a few drinks can be enjoyable, researchers hope their findings will help highlight the dangers of dependent drinking.Angry outburstsPeople build up tolerance to alcohol over time and can end up drinking more to feel the same "positive" effects that they enjoy.Image copyright Getty ImagesBut they also risk getting negative ones too, says researcher Prof Mark Bellis from Public Health Wales NHS Trust.The anonymous online survey, which recruited respondents via newspaper and magazine adverts and social media, found:Red wine appeared to make people more lethargic than white wineRespondents were most likely to report feeling relaxed when drinking red wine or beerMore than 40% said drinking spirits made them feel sexyOver half said drinking spirits also gave them energy and confidenceBut around a third said they felt aggressive when drinking spiritsDrinking spirits was more likely than all other drink types to be associated with feelings of aggression, illness, restlessness and tearfulnessMen were significantly more likely than women to associate feelings of aggression with all types of alcohol, particularly heavier drinkersHowever, the findings show only an association and do not explain the reasons for changes.Prof Bellis said the setting in which the alcohol was consumed was an important factor that the study tried to take into consideration by asking about drinking at home and outside of the home."Young people will often drink spirits on a night out, whereas wine might be drunk more at home, with a meal."There will be an element of expectation too. Someone who wants to relax might choose to have a beer or a glass of wine."Image copyright Getty ImagesHe said the way different drinks are marketed and promoted might encourage people to select certain drinks to suit different moods, but that this could backfire if it triggered negative emotions."People may rely on alcohol to help them feel a certain way. People might drink to feel more confident or relaxed but they also risk other negative emotional responses too."Prof Bellis and his colleagues at King's College London said the findings suggested that dependent drinkers might rely on alcohol to generate the positive emotions they associated with drinking - they were five times more likely to feel energised than low-risk drinkers.He also said the study revealed a difference between men and women's emotional relationship with different alcoholic drinks."We got stronger emotional relationships with women across pretty well every type of emotion, except for aggression." Aggression, he said, was more likely to be felt among men.Dr John Larsen, from Drinkaware, said: "This study highlights the importance of understanding why people choose to drink certain alcoholic drinks and what effect they expect these drinks will have on them."The UK chief medical officers' guideline for both men and women states that in order to keep health risks from alcohol to a low level it is safest not to be drinking more than 14 units a week on a regular basis."That equates to 12 single measures of spirits, six pints of beer or six 175ml glasses of wine a week.Experts say setting a minimum unit price of 50 pence per unit would help cut alcohol-related deaths.A minimum price policy will come into force on 1 May 2018 in Scotland.Legislation to establish a minimum price is currently under active consideration by the Welsh Government and by the Irish Senate. There are no plans yet to do the same in England, although the Home Office says the policy is under review.
Dog ownership lowers early death risk, study finds
Researchers found a lower risk of cardiovascular disease in owners of dogs, especially hunting breeds.
Image copyright Getty ImagesDog owners have a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease or other causes, a study of 3.4 million Swedes has found.The team analysed national registries for people aged 40 to 80, and compared them to dog ownership registers.They found there was a lower risk of cardiovascular disease in owners of dogs, particularly of hunting breeds.While owning a dog may help physical activity, researchers said it may be active people who choose to own dogs.They also said owning a dog may protect people from cardiovascular disease by increasing their social contact or wellbeing, or by changing the owner's bacterial microbiome.The microbiome is the collection of microscopic species that live in the gut. It's thought a dog may influence its owner's microbiomes as dogs change the dirt in home environments, exposing people to bacteria they may not have encountered otherwise.Image copyright Getty ImagesThe researchers said dogs had a particularly protective effect for those who live alone."The results showed that single dog owners had a 33% reduction in risk of death and 11% reduction in risk of heart attack," compared to single non-owners, said lead study author Mwenya Mubanga of Uppsala University.People who live alone have been shown previously to be at a higher risk of cardiovascular death.Dr Mubanga said: "Perhaps a dog may stand in as an important family member in the single households."For their study, published in Scientific Reports, the team looked at data from 2001 to 2012. In Sweden, every visit to a hospital is recorded in national databases - while dog ownership registration has been mandatory since 2001.Owning a dog from breeds originally bred for hunting, such as terriers, retrievers and scent hounds, was associated with the lowest risk of cardiovascular disorder.Image copyright Nick Triggle/Amber EvansDr Mike Knapton of the British Heart Foundation, said: "Owning a dog is associated with reduced mortality and risk of having heart disease. Previous studies have shown this association but have not been as conclusive - largely due to the population size studied here."Dog ownership has many benefits, and we may now be able to count better heart health as one of them."However, as many dog owners may agree, the main reason for owning a dog is the sheer joy."Whether you're a dog owner or not, keeping active is a great way to help improve your heart health."Tove Fall, senior author of the study, said there were some limitations: "These kind of epidemiological studies look for associations in large populations but do not provide answers on whether and how dogs could protect from cardiovascular disease."There might also be differences between owners and non-owners already before buying a dog, which could have influenced our results, such as those people choosing to get a dog tending to be more active and of better health."
